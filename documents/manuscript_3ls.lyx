dinger equation) and the classical electromagnetic fields (with Maxwell's
 equations) self-consistently, Ehrenfest+R dynamics goes further by including
 an additional emprirical relaxation to recover the correct spontaneous
 emission rate.
 As a result of this correction, Ehrenfest+R dynamics recover qualitatively
 significant features that are absent from standard Ehrenfest dynamics,
 including both resonant and off-resonant Raman signals.
 For resonant Raman scattering, we show that Ehrenfest+R dynamics are in
 quantitative agreement with Kramers-Heisenberg-Dirac (KHD) theory.

 In general, because it relies on a sum over all states (nuclear and electronic)

One long term goal for our research groups is to study plasmonic systems
 with strong light-matter couplings where Raman scattering is a very sensitive
 probe of the collective behavior of electronic dynamics.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sukharev_optics_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 For such systems, a direct implementation of KHD theory is not feasible
 (because of the large number of states required) and is also likely not
 relevant (because the presence of strong light-matter should invalidate
 perturbation theory).
 Thus, in order for us to model such systems, and to take into account strong
 light-matter couplings, the most natural approach is to consider the quantum
 subsystems and classical electromagnetic (EM) fields on an equal footing.
 This approach stands in contrast to most existing semiclassical approaches
 for spectroscopy, which treat the incoming field as an fixed external perturbat
ion, and extrapolate the behavior of quantum subsystems to predict light
 emission.

\begin_layout Standard
Now, obviously, any computational approach to spectroscopy that promises
 "equal footing" for light and matter will necessarily require large approximati
ons; in particular, we expect that a quantum treatment of the EM field will
 be prohibitively difficult, and one will necessarily need to work with
 classical electromagnetic fields.
 The simplest example of such a mixed quantum-classical approach is self-consist
ent Ehrenfest dynamics.
 Unfortunately, Ehrenfest dynamics do not fully recover spontaneous emission
 and thus are unlikely to capture Raman scattering either.

 That being said, we are unaware of a systematic study answering this question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a previous publication, our laboratory has proposed an improved so-called
 "Ehrenfest+R" algorithm that builds in spontaneous emission on top of Ehrenfest
 dynamics by enforcing additional relaxation for two-level systems.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "chen_ehrenfest+r_2018"

\end_inset

 In this second paper, our goal is to generalize Ehrenfest+R to the case
 of a multi-level (i.e.
 more than two-level) quantum subsystem.
 We will show that such a generalization can capture both resonant and off-reson
ant Raman scattering (at least for a three-level molecular system).
 Our results are in quantitative agreement with KHD theory.
 The data presented here strongly suggests that Ehrenfest+R dynamics (and
 other spruced-up versions of mean-field dynamics) can be excellent tools
 for exploring interesting light-matter interactions far beyond basic absorption
 of Raman theory at the level of KHD formalism (and applicable to large
 subsystems, e.g., plasmonic systems).

 To take into account strong couplings through radiation fields in a semiclassic

 However, existing semiclassical approaches usually treat the incoming field
 as a standalone field and extrapolate the behavior of quantum subsystems
 for emission lights.

Raman light scattering is an inelastic process whereby the interaction between
 the incident photons and molecules can lead to an energy shift in emission
 spectra for a small fraction of the scattered photons.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
basically it is two spontaneous emission
\end_layout

\end_inset

To qualitatively describe Raman light scattering, consider a molecular system
 with interactions between electronic states and nuclear vibrations.
 Incident photons excite the molecular system to an intermediate state (which
 could be a virtual state), and that intermediate state is subsequently
 coupled both to the ground state as well to other vibronic states.
 Thus, the system can emit photons with two different frequencies through
 spontaneous emission.

 On the one hand, a transition back to the ground state yields scattered
 photons with the same energy with the incident photons (which is known
 as Rayleigh scattering).
 On the other hand, a transition to other vibronic states will generate
 scattered photons with energies different from the incident photons (which
 is known as Raman scattering).

To quantify the KHD Raman scattering formalism, we consider a model system

 We assume the energies of the vibronic states are

 Ehrenfest+R dynamics should provide a proper tool for a mixed quantum-classical
 simulation since the algorithm was designed to recover spontaneous emission.
 One can generalize the Ehrenfest+R method to the case of more than a two

 transitions between individual pairs of vibronic states, i.e.

To implement a pairwise treatment for Ehrenfest+R dynamics, the Liouville

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

and the off-diagonal element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[{\cal L}_{R}\widehat{\rho}\right]_{ij}$
\end_inset

 are chosen to maintain the purity of the density matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[{\cal L}_{R}^{i\rightarrow f}\widehat{\rho}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The +R relaxation rate 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{R}^{fi}$
\end_inset

 for the transistion 
\begin_inset Formula $i\rightarrow f$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k_{R}^{fi}\equiv2\kappa_{fi}\left(1-\rho_{ff}\right)\text{Im}\left[\frac{\rho_{fi}}{\left|\rho_{fi}\right|}e^{i\phi}\right]^{2}.\label{eq:k_R}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\phi\in\left(0,2\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 is a phase chosen randomly for each Ehrenfest+R trajectory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, we use a pure state representation for the density matrix:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\rho}=\left|\psi\right\rangle \left\langle \psi\right|$
\end_inset

 with wavefunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\left(t\right)\right\rangle =c_{0}\left(t\right)\left|0\right\rangle +c_{1}\left(t\right)\left|1\right\rangle +c_{2}\left(t\right)\left|2\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 The additional relaxation embodied by 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal L}_{R}^{i\rightarrow f}$
\end_inset

 is defined by a transition operator:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
{\cal T}\left[k_{R}^{fi}\right]:\left(\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
c_{i}\\
\vdots\\
c_{f}\\
\vdots
\end{array}\right)\rightarrow\left(\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
\frac{c_{i}}{\left|c_{i}\right|}\sqrt{\left|c_{i}\right|^{2}-k_{R}^{fi}\left|c_{i}\right|^{2}dt}\\
\vdots\\
\frac{c_{f}}{\left|c_{f}\right|}\sqrt{\left|c_{f}\right|^{2}+k_{R}^{fi}\left|c_{f}\right|^{2}dt}\\
\vdots
\end{array}\right).\label{eq:transistion_operator}
\end{equation}

Thus in practice, the time evolution of the subsystem wavefunction is carried
 out by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\psi\left(t+dt\right)\right\rangle ={\cal T}\left[k_{R}^{12}\right]{\cal T}\left[k_{R}^{02}\right]e^{-i\widehat{H}^{\mathrm{el}}dt/\hbar}\left|\psi\left(t\right)\right\rangle .\label{eq:propagation-system}

 For the initial state 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}=1$

 by the incident field, but will never populate state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1\right\rangle $

 Therefore, effectively we always have 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 within Ehrenfest dynamics and the spontaneous emission via electronic transitio
n

 As a general rule of thumb, because standard Ehrenfest dynamics are effectively
 classical dynamics, whereas there is only a single frequency

 in the EM field and the EM field strength is weak, Ehrenfest dynamics will
 predict all response to be at the same frequency

In this work, we have generalized the Ehrenfest+R approach to treat a multi-leve
l (more than two-level) system and we have demonstrated that such an approach
 recapitulates Raman scattering.

\end_inset

In the context of a three-level system model, the proposed prescription
 of +R corrections can overcome the qualitative deficiencies of Ehrenfest
 dynamics and recover both (Stokes and anti-Stokes) resonant and off-resonant
 Raman scattering.
 In addition, a comparison with the quantum mechanical KHD formalism shows
 that Ehrenfest+R dynamics agrees quantitatively with resonant Raman scattering
 cross sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the promising results in this work, there are many further questions
 that need to be addressed.
 First, the proposed prescription is based on pairwise +R transitions without
 relative phases for rescaling fields.
 Do not the relative phases we have introduced also yield quantum fluctuations
 that one have ignored? Have we found the optimal semiclassical approach
 for quantum electrodynamics with more than two electronic states? Second,
 the data in this work was generated for a three level system in one dimension
 only, assuming that the polarization density has a simple Gaussian profile.
 Does our prescription work for a system with arbitrary polarization density
 in three dimensions ? Finally, the current setup includes one quantum subsystem
 only.
 How can we to treat the collective behavior of a set of molecular subsystems
 with strong electronic coupling? These questions will be investigated in
 the future.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Our current prescription of Ehrenfest+R dynamics has several advantages.
 First, it conserves the total electrodynamics energy.
 Second, since the system transition is effectively continuous and the stochasti
c EM field transition is minimal in magnitude, it is numerically stable.
 Third, the cost of each Ehrenfest+R trajectory is of the same order magnitude
 as the standard Ehrenfest dynamics, and it is easy to reach convergence.
 We note that the success of our prescription relies on the fact that the
 spontaneous emission follows Fermi's golden rule.
 Therefore, applying Ehrenfest+R method to other problems requires further
 modification of the current prescription.
 Namely, the framework pave the way for possible varieties of mixed quantum-clas
sical methods derived from the analysis of the electrodynamical QCLE and
 Ehrenfest EOM.

Future work will investigate Ehrenfest+R dynamics in detail in three dimensions,
 with weak and strong incident EM fields, with arbitrary numbers of electronic
 states, and with general forms of the transition dipole moments.
 We will also incorporate non-adiabatic methods for electron–phonon dynamics,
 such as surface hopping and quantum master equations, to account for nuclear
 dynamics and decoherence.

By definition, the photon cross section is the number of photons emitted
 per time, divided by the incident photon flux.

 to obtain:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left\Vert \psi^{\left(2\right)}\left(t\right)\right\Vert ^{2}=\frac{2\pi E_{S}^{2}E_{I}^{2}}{16\hbar^{2}}\sum_{f}\left|\alpha_{fi}\left(\omega_{I}\right)\right|^{2}\delta\left(\omega_{S}-\Delta\omega\right)\label{eq:2nd_order_wf_0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the frequency-dependent polarizability is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{fi}\left(\omega_{I}\right)=\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{0}^{\infty}d\tau\left\langle \psi_{f}\right|\widehat{\mu}e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\widehat{H}_{0}\tau}\widehat{\mu}e^{i\left(\omega_{I}+\omega_{i}\right)\tau}\left|\psi_{i}\right\rangle .\label{eq:alpha_fi}

 If we now invoke the 1D density of states for photons (

Lastly, in order to express the scattering cross section in terms of photon

 To do so ,we note the simple and general relationship between the electric

\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 and the number of photon 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $L$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{E^{2}}{2}=\hbar\omega\frac{N}{L}.\label{eq:Einstein-photon}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{N}{L}$

 Note that Eq.

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is valid for both incoming and scattered photons.
 For incoming photons, the incident field intensity satisfies
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{I}^{2}=2\hbar\omega_{I}\frac{N_{I}}{L}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For scattered photons, assuming spontaneous emission, we must have

\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{S}^{2}=\frac{2\hbar\omega_{S}}{L}.

With these relations, we rewrite Eq.
