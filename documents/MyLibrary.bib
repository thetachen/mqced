	abstract = {A simple electrostatic method for the calculation of optical transition energies of pigments in protein environments is presented and applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex of Prosthecochloris aestuarii and Chlorobium tepidum. The method, for the first time, allows us to reach agreement between experimental optical spectra and calculations based on transition energies of pigments that are calculated in large part independently, rather than fitted to the spectra. In this way it becomes possible to understand the molecular mechanism allowing the protein to trigger excitation energy transfer reactions. The relative shift in excitation energies of the seven bacteriochlorophyll-a pigments of the FMO complex of P. aestuarii and C. tepidum are obtained from calculations of electrochromic shifts due to charged amino acids, assuming a standard protonation pattern of the protein, and by taking into account the three different ligand types of the pigments. The calculations provide an explanation of some of the earlier results for the transition energies obtained from fits of optical spectra. In addition, those earlier fits are verified here by using a more advanced theory of optical spectra, a genetic algorithm, and excitonic couplings obtained from electrostatic calculations that take into account the influence of the dielectric protein environment. The two independent calculations of site energies strongly favor one of the two possible orientations of the FMO trimer relative to the photosynthetic membrane, which were identified by electron microscopic studies and linear dichroism experiments. Efficient transfer of excitation energy to the reaction center requires bacteriochlorophylls 3 and 4 to be the linker pigments. The temporal and spatial transfer of excitation energy through the FMO complex is calculated to proceed along two branches, with transfer times that differ by an order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {We study the statistics of heat transferred in a given time interval tM, through a finite harmonic chain, called the center, which is connected to two heat baths, the left (L) and the right (R), that are maintained at two temperatures. The center atoms are driven by external time-dependent forces. We calculate the cumulant generating function (CGF) for the heat transferred out of the left lead, QL, based on the two-time quantum measurement concept and using the nonequilibrium Green's function method. The CGF can be concisely expressed in terms of Green's functions of the center and an argument-shifted self-energy of the lead. The expression of the CGF is valid in both transient and steady-state regimes. We consider three initial conditions for the density operator and show numerically, for a one-atom junction, how their transient behaviors differ from each other but, finally, approach the same steady state, independent of the initial distributions. We also derive the CGF for the joint probability distribution P(QL,QR), and discuss the correlations between QL and QR. We calculate the CGF for total entropy production in the reservoirs. In the steady state we explicitly show that the CGFs obey steady-state fluctuation theorems. We obtain classical results by taking ??0. We also apply our method to the counting of the electron number and electron energy, for which the associated self-energy is obtained from the usual lead self-energy by multiplying a phase and shifting the contour time, respectively.},

Going beyond electronic transport characterization, these new studies are highlighting both the fundamental and applied aspects of mechanical, optical and thermoelectric properties at the atomic and molecular scales. Furthermore, experimental demonstrations of quantum interference and manipulation of electronic and nuclear spins in single-molecule circuits are heralding new device concepts with no classical analogues.

	doi = {10.1063/1.2131056},
	abstract = {The key factors that distinguish algorithms for nonadiabatic mixed quantum/classical (MQC) simulations from each other are how they incorporate quantum decoherence-the fact that classical nuclei must eventually cause a quantum superposition state to collapse into a pure state-and how they model the effects of decoherence on the quantum and classical subsystems. Most algorithms use distinct mechanisms for modeling nonadiabatic transitions between pure quantum basis states ("surface hops") and for calculating the loss of quantum-mechanical phase information (e.g., the decay of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix). In our view, however, both processes should be unified in a single description of decoherence. In this paper, we start from the density matrix of the total system and use the frozen Gaussian approximation for the nuclear wave function to derive a nuclear-induced decoherence rate for the electronic degrees of freedom. We then use this decoherence rate as the basis for a new nonadiabatic MQC molecular-dynamics (MD) algorithm, which we call mean-field dynamics with stochastic decoherence (MF-SD). MF-SD begins by evolving the quantum subsystem according to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, leading to mean-field dynamics. MF-SD then uses the nuclear-induced decoherence rate to determine stochastically at each time step whether the system remains in a coherent mixed state or decoheres. Once it is determined that the system should decohere, the quantum subsystem undergoes an instantaneous total wave-function collapse onto one of the adiabatic basis states and the classical velocities are adjusted to conserve energy. Thus, MF-SD combines surface hops and decoherence into a single idea: decoherence in MF-SD does not require the artificial introduction of reference states, auxiliary trajectories, or trajectory swarms, which also makes MF-SD much more computationally efficient than other nonadiabatic MQC MD algorithms. The unified definition of decoherence in MF-SD requires only a single ad hoc parameter, which is not adjustable but instead is determined by the spatial extent of the nonadiabatic coupling. We use MF-SD to solve a series of one-dimensional scattering problems and find that MF-SD is as quantitatively accurate as several existing nonadiabatic MQC MD algorithms and significantly more accurate for some problems.},

For each classical trajectory, the nonadiabatic transitions take place only when the surface gap attains a local minimum. Numerical experiments are performed with deterministically branching trajectories and with probabilistic surface hopping. The deterministic and the probabilistic approach confirm the affinity of both the LZ probabilities, as well as the good approximation of the reference solution computed by solving the Schrödinger equation via a grid based pseudo-spectral method. Visualizations of position expectations and superimposed surface hopping trajectories with reference position densities illustrate the effective dynamics of the investigated algorithms.},

However, the more general case of junctions with several conduction channels has received very little attention. Here we study electron?vibration interaction in multichannel molecular junctions, formed by introduction of either benzene or carbon dioxide between platinum electrodes. By combining shot noise and differential conductance measurements, we analyze the effect of vibration activation on conductance in view of the distribution of conduction channels. Based on the shift of vibration energy while the junction is stretched, we identify vibration modes with transverse and longitudinal symmetry. The detection of different vibration modes is ascribed to efficient vibration coupling to different conduction channels according to symmetry considerations. While most of our observations can be explained in view of the theoretical models for a single conduction channel, the appearance of conductance enhancement, induced by electron?vibration interaction, at high conductance values indicates either unexpected high electron?vibration coupling or interchannel scattering.},

We address a longstanding theoretical issue, namely whether singlet fission proceeds via two sequential electron transfer steps mediated by charge-transfer states or via a direct two-electron transfer process. We find evidence for a superexchange mediated mechanism, whereby the fission process proceeds through virtual charge-transfer states which may be very high in energy. In particular, this mechanism predicts efficient singlet fission on the sub-picosecond timescale, in reasonable agreement with experiment. We investigate the role played by molecular vibrations in mediating relaxation and decoherence, finding that different physically reasonable forms for the bath relaxation function give similar results. We also examine the competing direct coupling mechanism and find it to yield fission rates slower in comparison with the superexchange mechanism for the dimer. We discuss implications for crystalline pentacene, including the limitations of the dimer model.},

In this work, we assemble the components of a comprehensive microscopic theory of singlet fission that connects excited state quantum chemistry calculations with finite-temperature quantum relaxation theory. We elaborate on the distinction between localized diabatic and delocalized exciton bases for the interpretation of singlet fission experiments in both the time and frequency domains. We discuss various approximations to the exact density matrix dynamics and propose Redfield theory as an ideal compromise between speed and accuracy for the detailed investigation of singlet fission in dimers, clusters, and crystals. Investigations of small model systems based on parameters typical of singlet fission demonstrate the numerical accuracy and practical utility of this approach.},

This situation provides a challenge to theoretical investigation since most approaches are accurate only when a certain energetic parameter is small compared to others in the problem. Here we show that in these difficult regimes, the Ehrenfest approach provides a good starting point for a dynamical description of the energy transfer process due to its ability to accurately treat coupling to slow environmental modes. To further improve on the accuracy of the Ehrenfest approach, we use our reduced density matrix hybrid framework to treat the faster environmental modes quantum mechanically, at the level of a perturbative master equation. This combined approach is shown to provide an efficient and quantitative description of electronic energy transfer in a model dimer and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex and is used to investigate the effect of environmental preparation on the resulting dynamics.},

The presented method only requires the calculation of the system's reduced density matrix averaged over the quantum core degrees of freedom which is then coupled to a classically evolved reservoir to treat the remaining modes. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the spin-boson problem using the noninteracting blip approximation to treat the system and core, and Ehrenfest dynamics to treat the reservoir. The resulting hybrid methodology is accurate for both fast and slow baths, since it naturally reduces to its composite methods in their respective regimes of validity. In addition, our combined method is shown to yield good results in intermediate regimes where neither approximation alone is accurate and to perform equally well for both strong and weak system-bath coupling. Our approach therefore provides an accurate and efficient methodology for calculating quantum dynamics in complex systems.},

The nuclear quantum effects of the transferring hydrogen are included with a mixed quantum/classical molecular dynamics method in which the hydrogen nucleus is described as a multidimensional vibrational wave function. The free energy profiles are obtained as functions of a collective reaction coordinate. A perturbation formula is derived to incorporate the vibrationally adiabatic nuclear quantum effects into the free energy profiles. The dynamical effects are studied with the molecular dynamics with quantum transitions (MDQT) surface hopping method, which incorporates nonadiabatic transitions among the adiabatic hydrogen vibrational states. The MDQT method is combined with a reactive flux approach to calculate the transmission coefficient and to investigate the real-time dynamics of reactive trajectories. This hybrid approach includes nuclear quantum effects such as zero point energy, hydrogen tunneling, and excited vibrational states, as well as the dynamics of the complete enzyme and solvent. The nuclear quantum effects are incorporated during the generation of the free energy profiles and dynamical trajectories rather than subsequently added as corrections. Moreover, this methodology provides detailed mechanistic information at the molecular level and allows the calculation of rates and kinetic isotope effects. An initial application of this approach to the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase is also presented.},

Such coarse graining causes the quantum paths to lose coherence as the various possible classical paths associated with each quantum state diverge. This defines a reduction mapping of the quantum density matrix, and we derive a quantum master equation suitable for mixed quantum?classical systems. The equation includes two terms: first, the ordinary quantum Liouvillian which is parametrized by a single classical path, and second, a quantum decoherence term that includes both a coherence time and length scale which are determined by the dynamics of the classical paths. Model calculations for electronic coherence loss in nonadiabatic mixed quantum?classical dynamics are presented as examples. For a model charge transferchemical reaction with nonadiabatic transitions, application of the present formulation reveals that nonadiabaticity is diminished as the decoherence timescale becomes shorter and adiabatic dynamics are recovered in the limit of rapid decoherence.},

Specifically, we study the weak-to-intermediate system?bath coupling regime at high temperatures kBT/? {\textbackslash}textgreater ?, with ? as the characteristic frequency of the two-state system. The BR formalism and NIBA can lead to close results for the dynamics of the reduced density matrix (RDM) in a certain range of parameters. However, relatively small deviations in the RDM dynamics propagate into significant qualitative discrepancies in the transport behavior. Similarly, beyond the strict nonadiabatic limit NIBA?s prediction for the heat current is qualitatively incorrect: It fails to capture the turnover behavior of the current with tunneling energy and temperature. Thus, techniques that proved meaningful for describing the RDM dynamics, to some extent even beyond their rigorous range of validity, should be used with great caution in heat transfer calculations, because qualitative-serious failures develop once parameters are mildly stretched beyond the techniques? working assumptions.},

	abstract = {The dynamical interplay between electron-electron interactions and electron-phonon coupling is investigated within the Anderson-Holstein model, a minimal model for open quantum systems that embody these effects. The influence of phonons on spectral and transport properties is explored in equilibrium, for nonequilibrium steady state and for transient dynamics after a quench. Both the particle-hole symmetric and the more generic particle-hole asymmetric cases are studied. The treatment is based on two complementary noncrossing approximations, the first of which is constructed around the weak-coupling limit and the second around the polaron limit. In general, the two methods disagree in nontrivial ways, indicating that more reliable approaches to the problem are needed. The frameworks used here can form the starting point for numerically exact methods based on bold-line continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms capable of treating open systems simultaneously coupled to multiple fermionic and bosonic baths.},

The purely inelastic features correspond to an applied bias around the energy of a vibron, while the inelastic-resonant features correspond to peaks (resonance) in the conductance.

We apply our method to a model system consisting of a single electronic level coupled to a single vibration mode in the molecule, which is in contact with two electron reservoirs. Higher-order diagrams beyond the usual self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) are included in the calculations. In this paper we consider the effects of the double-exchange diagram and the diagram in which the vibron propagator is renormalized by one electron-hole bubble. We study in detail the effects of the first- and second-order diagrams on the spectral functions for a large set of parameters and for different transport regimes (resonant and off-resonant cases), both at equilibrium and in the presence of a finite applied bias. We also study the linear response (linear conductance) of the nanojunction for all the different regimes.

	abstract = {The crossover between two customary limits of phonon-assisted tunneling, the adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes, is studied systematically in the framework of a minimal model for molecular devices: a resonant level coupled by displacement to a localized vibrational mode. Conventionally associated with the limits where the phonon frequency is either sufficiently small or sufficiently large as compared to the bare electronic hopping rate, we show that the crossover between the two regimes is governed for strong electron-phonon interactions primarily by the polaronic shift rather than the phonon frequency. In particular, the perturbative adiabatic limit is approached only as the bare hopping rate Γ{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi \_moz-math-font-style="italic"{\textgreater}\&Gamma; exceeds the polaronic shift, leaving an extended window of couplings where Γ{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi \_moz-math-font-style="italic"{\textgreater}\&Gamma; well exceeds the phonon frequency and yet the physics is basically that of the antiadiabatic regime. We term this intermediate regime the extended antiadiabatic regime. The effective low-energy Hamiltonian in the traditional and the extended antiadiabatic regime is shown to be the (purely fermionic) interacting resonant-level model, with parameters that we extract from numerical renormalization-group calculations. The extended antiadiabatic regime is followed in turn by a true crossover region where the polaron gets progressively undressed. In this latter region, the phonon configuration strongly deviates from a simple superposition of just one or two coherent states. The renormalized tunneling rate, which serves as the low-energy scale in the problem and thus sets the width of the tunneling resonance, is found to follow an approximate scaling form on going from the adiabatic to the antiadiabatic regime. Charging properties are governed by two distinct mechanisms at the extended antiadiabatic and into the crossover region, giving rise to characteristic shoulders in the low-temperature conductance as a function of gate voltage. These shoulders serve as a distinct experimental fingerprint of phonon-assisted tunneling when the electron-phonon coupling is strong.},

	abstract = {Photosynthetic complexes are exquisitely tuned to capture solar light efficiently, and then transmit the excitation energy to reaction centres, where long term energy storage is initiated. The energy transfer mechanism is often described by semiclassical models that invoke 'hopping' of excited-state populations along discrete energy levels. Two-dimensional Fourier transform electronic spectroscopy has mapped these energy levels and their coupling in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) bacteriochlorophyll complex, which is found in green sulphur bacteria and acts as an energy 'wire' connecting a large peripheral light-harvesting antenna, the chlorosome, to the reaction centre. The spectroscopic data clearly document the dependence of the dominant energy transport pathways on the spatial properties of the excited-state wavefunctions of the whole bacteriochlorophyll complex. But the intricate dynamics of quantum coherence, which has no classical analogue, was largely neglected in the analyses-even though electronic energy transfer involving oscillatory populations of donors and acceptors was first discussed more than 70 years ago, and electronic quantum beats arising from quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes have been predicted and indirectly observed. Here we extend previous two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy investigations of the FMO bacteriochlorophyll complex, and obtain direct evidence for remarkably long-lived electronic quantum coherence playing an important part in energy transfer processes within this system. The quantum coherence manifests itself in characteristic, directly observable quantum beating signals among the excitons within the Chlorobium tepidum FMO complex at 77 K. This wavelike characteristic of the energy transfer within the photosynthetic complex can explain its extreme efficiency, in that it allows the complexes to sample vast areas of phase space to find the most efficient path.},

Its discussions of formalism and applications move easily between general theory and direct use by offering illustrations of principles to specific cases. Chapters on second quantization and statistical mechanics introduce students to ground-state (zero-temperature) formalism, which is explored by way of Green?s functions and field theory (fermions), Fermi systems, linear response and collective modes, and Bose systems. Finite-temperature formalism is examined through field theory at finite temperature, physical systems at finite temperature, and real-time Green?s functions and linear response. Additional topics cover canonical transformations and applications to physical systems in terms of nuclear matter, phonons and electrons, superconductivity, and superfluid helium as well as applications to finite systems. Graduate students will find this text enormously practical in making the transition from taking courses in quantum mechanics to interpreting the vast quantity of literature concerning the many-body problem.},

In cavity QED, the observation of the vacuum Rabi mode splitting is used to investigate the nature of matter?light interaction at a quantum-mechanical level. However, this effect can, at least in principle, be explained classically as the normal mode splitting of two coupled linear oscillators. It has been suggested that an observation of the scaling of the resonant atom?photon coupling strength in the Jaynes?Cummings energy ladder with the square root of photon number n is sufficient to prove that the system is quantum mechanical in nature. Here we report a direct spectroscopic observation of this characteristic quantum nonlinearity. Measuring the photonic degree of freedom of the coupled system, our measurements provide unambiguous spectroscopic evidence for the quantum nature of the resonant atom?field interaction in cavity QED. We explore atom?photon superposition states involving up to two photons, using a spectroscopic pump and probe technique. The experiments have been performed in a circuit QED set-up, in which very strong coupling is realized by the large dipole coupling strength and the long coherence time of a superconducting qubit embedded in a high-quality on-chip microwave cavity. Circuit QED systems also provide a natural quantum interface between flying qubits (photons) and stationary qubits for applications in quantum information processing and communication.},

The scaling equations are derived by applying a perturbative renormalization group to the system?s partition function. The dynamics is studied using Feynman?s influence-functional theory. We compute directly the nonlinear mobility of the Brownian particle in the weak-corrugation limit, for arbitrary temperature. The linear mobility ?l is always larger than the corresponding classical mobility which follows from the Langevin equation. In the localized regime ?{\textbackslash}textgreater1, ?l is an increasing function of temperature, consistent with transport via a thermally assisted hopping mechanism. For ?{\textbackslash}textless1, ?l(T) shows a nonmonotonic dependence on T with a minimum at a temperature T*. This is due to a crossover between quantum tunneling below T* and thermally assisted hopping above T*. For low friction the crossover occurs when the particle?s thermal de Broglie wavelength is roughly equal to the distance between minima in the periodic potential. We suggest that the regime ?{\textbackslash}textless1 describes the physics of the observed nonmonotonic temperature dependence of muon diffusion in metals.},

The self-consistent calculation allows also for evaluating other related quantities such as the power loss during electron conduction. Regarding the inelastic spectrum, two types of inelastic contributions are discussed. Features associated with real and virtual energy transfer to phonons are usually observed in the second derivative of the current I with respect to the voltage Phi when plotted against Phi. Signatures of resonant tunneling driven by an intermediate molecular ion appear as peaks in the first derivative dI/dPhi and may show phonon sidebands.

This coupling, or friction, if strong enough, may substantially slow down motion along the reaction coordinate, and thus vitiate the assumption of electron transfer being nonadiabatic with respect to the nuclei. Here, a simple, fully quantum mechanical model for electron transfer using a one mode treatment which incorporates this coupling is studied. Path integral methods are used to study the dependence of the reaction rate on friction, and the limits of the moderate and the high friction are analyzed in detail. The first limit will prevail if the reaction coordinate is, e.g., an underdamped nuclear vibration, whereas the second limit will prevail if it corresponds to a slow or diffusive degree of freedom. In the high?friction limit, the reaction rate is explicitly shown to vary between the nonadiabatic and adiabatic expressions as the tunneling matrix element and/or the friction are varied. Starting from a path integral expression for the time evolution of the reduced density matrix for the electron and reaction coordinate, a Fokker?Planck equation is obtained which reduces in the high?friction limit to a Smoluchowski equation similar to one solved by Zusman.},

It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed.

	abstract = {The time?dependent self?consistent field method (TDSCF) is formulated and applied to the study of intramolecular dynamics and unimolecular decomposition processes. The method is illustrated by calculations on vibrational predissociation in van der Waals molecules, such as I2(v)Ne?I2(v?)+Ne. The TDSCF has the advantage of achieving formal separability of the modes by associating a time?dependent Hamiltonian with each mode, while permitting (possibly extensive) energy transfer among the modes via the time?dependent mean potential which acts on each mode. We present quantal, semiclassical, and classical versions of the method; a proper classical limit of the quantum TDSCF replaces the averages over wave functions by averages over self?consistently obtained bundles of trajectories. In all three versions, considerable computational economy is retained in comparison with full dynamics calculation. A detailed study is made of those properties which can be correctly obtained in such a time?dependent mean field theory. Attention is drawn to problems such as the occurrence of spurious states in the asymptotic region, and a simple method for avoiding them is suggested. We find for the I2(v)Ne vibrational predissociation that the TDSCF compares well with corresponding full dynamics calculations for average single mode properties such as dissociation lifetimes and the translational energy release. Moreover, comparison with classical trajectory calculations shows that the TDSCF method reproduces the essential dynamical mechanism of the dissociation (in?phase impulsive I???Ne collision following several ineffective vibrations). The self?consistent bundle trajectories and the time?dependent mean fields are analyzed, and provide insight into the process dynamics. It is concluded that the TDSCF approach in both quantal and quasiclassical versions is a potentially powerful tool in the study of intramolecular energy transfer and unimolecular dissociation.},

	abstract = {Two complimentary master equation approaches for the study of condensed phase charge transfer processes are developed. The first approach is appropriate when the (diabatic) activation energy is larger than the electronic coupling strength, and thus localized tight binding states form a zeroth-order set of electronic states. The second approach, the “pure dephasing reference system” (PDRS) master equation method, is designed to study the case where charge is delocalized over the donor and acceptor sites, and a zeroth-order set of “quasiadiabatic” states are used as a reference system. It is argued that a large majority of the electron transfer parameter space may be accurately covered with these two methods. Particular emphasis is placed on the treatment of nonequilibrium initial preparation, short-time nonexponential behavior, and backflow. The methods outlined in this work are general enough to treat anharmonic environments. A semiclassical implementation of the master equation approaches appropriate for anharmonic environments is outlined.

	abstract = {The conditions under which quantum-classical Liouville dynamics may be reduced to a master equation are investigated. Systems that can be partitioned into a quantum-classical subsystem interacting with a classical bath are considered. Starting with an exact non-Markovian equation for the diagonal elements of the density matrix, an evolution equation for the subsystem density matrix is derived. One contribution to this equation contains the bath average of a memory kernel that accounts for all coherences in the system. It is shown to be a rapidly decaying function, motivating a Markovian approximation on this term in the evolution equation. The resulting subsystem density matrix equation is still non-Markovian due to the fact that bath degrees of freedom have been projected out of the dynamics. Provided the computation of nonequilibrium average values or correlation functions is considered, the non-Markovian character of this equation can be removed by lifting the equation into the full phase space of the system. This leads to a trajectory description of the dynamics where each fictitious trajectory accounts for decoherence due to the bath degrees of freedom. The results are illustrated by computations of the rate constant of a model nonadiabatic chemical reaction.},

The computation of expectation values requires a knowledge of the quantum dynamics of operators and sampling from initial states of the density matrix describing the subsystem and bath. We consider situations where the quantum evolution can be approximated by quantum-classical Liouville dynamics and examine the circumstances under which the evolution can be reduced to surface-hopping dynamics, where the evolution consists of trajectory segments exclusively evolving on single adiabatic surfaces, with probabilistic hops between these surfaces. The justification for the reduction depends on the validity of a Markovian approximation on a bath averaged memory kernel that accounts for quantum coherence in the system. We show that such a reduction is often possible when initial sampling is from either the quantum or classical bath initial distributions. If the average is taken only over the quantum dispersion that broadens the classical distribution, then such a reduction is not always possible.},

While some of these phenomena have been observed or proposed before, the present analysis extends previous studies and allows a more detailed understanding of the underlying transport mechanisms. In particular, it is shown that many of the observed phenomena can only be explained if electron-hole pair creation processes at the molecule-lead interface are taken into account.

We substantiate our discussion with explicit numerical results for the nonequilibrium transport properties of a single-site Anderson impurity. The numerical effort of the HQME scheme scales linearly with the simulation time but increases (at worst exponentially) with decreasing temperature. In contrast, CT-QMC is less restricted by temperature at short times, but in general the cost of going to longer times is also exponential. After establishing the numerical exactness of the HQME scheme, we use it to elucidate the influence of different ways to induce transport through the impurity on the initial dynamics, discuss the phenomenon of coherent current oscillations, known as current ringing, and explain the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the steady-state magnetization as a result of competing broadening effects. We also elucidate the pronounced nonlinear magnetization dynamics, which appears on intermediate time scales in the presence of an asymmetric coupling to the electrodes.},

We then compare the method to a variety of other semiclassical methods, as well as to accurate quantum mechanical results for three-dimensional atom?diatom reactions and quenching processes; the deviations of the semiclassical results from the accurate quantum mechanical ones are averaged over nine cases. In the adiabatic electronic representation, the FMS-M method provides some improvement over Tully?s fewest switches trajectory surface hopping method. However, both methods, irrespective of electronic representation, systematically overpredict the extent of reaction in comparison to the exact quantum mechanical results.

	abstract = {Classical transition state theory(TST) provides the rigorous basis for the application of molecular dynamics (MD) to infrequent events, i.e., reactions that are slow due to a high energy barrier. The TST rate is simply the equilibrium flux through a surface that divides reactants from products. In order to apply MD to infrequent events, corrections to the TST rate that account for recrossings of the dividing surface are computed by starting trajectories at the dividing surface and integrating them backward and forward in time. Both classical TST and conventional MD invoke the adiabatic approximation, i.e., the assumption that nuclear motion evolves on a single potential energy surface. Many chemical rate processes involve multiple potential energy surfaces, however, and a number of ??surface?hopping?? MD methods have been developed in order to incorporate nonadiabatic transitions among the potential energy surfaces. In this paper we generalize TST to processes involving multiple potential energy surfaces. This provides the framework for a new method for MD simulation of infrequent events for reactions that evolve on multiple potential energy surfaces. We show how this method can be applied rigorously even in conjunction with phase?coherent surface?hopping methods, where the probability of switching potential energy surfaces depends on the history of the trajectory, so integrating trajectories backward to calculate the recrossing correction is problematic. We illustrate this new method by applying it in conjunction with the ??molecular dynamics with quantum transitions??

We use full classical mechanical molecular dynamics for the heavy atom degrees of freedom, including the solvent molecules, and treat the hydrogen motion quantum mechanically. We identify new obstacles that arise in this application of MDQT and present methods for overcoming them. We implement these new methods to demonstrate that application of MDQT to proton transfer in solution is computationally feasible and appears capable of accurately incorporating quantum mechanical phenomena such as tunneling and isotope effects. As an initial application of the method, we employ a model used previously by Azzouz and Borgis to represent the proton transferreactionAH?B?A ??H + B in liquid methyl chloride, where the AH?B complex corresponds to a typical phenol?amine complex. We have chosen this model, in part, because it exhibits both adiabatic and diabatic behavior, thereby offering a stringent test of the theory. MDQT proves capable of treating both limits, as well as the intermediate regime. Up to four quantum states were included in this simulation, and the method can easily be extended to include additional excited states, so it can be applied to a wide range of processes, such as photoassisted tunneling. In addition, this method is not perturbative, so trajectories can be continued after the barrier is crossed to follow the subsequent dynamics.},

By exploiting the features of coherent phonons with a pump-probe technique, one can study lattice motions in a sub-picosecond time range. The dephasing properties tell us not only about interaction dynamics with carriers (electrons and holes) or thermal phonons but also about point defects in crystals. Modulations of the coherent phonon amplitude by more than two modes are closely related to phonon-carrier or phonon-phonon interferences. Related to this phenomenon, formation of coherent phonons at higher harmonics gives direct evidence for phonon-phonon couplings. A combined study of coherent phonons and ultrafast carrier response can be useful for understanding phonon-carrier interaction dynamics. For metals like zinc, nonequilibrium electrons may dominate the dynamics of both relaxation and generation of coherent phonons. The frequency chirp of coherent phonons can be a direct measure of how and when phonon-phonon and phonon-carrier couplings occur. Carbon nanotubes show some complicated behavior due to the existence of many modes with different symmetries, resulting in superposition or interference. To illustrate one of the most interesting applications, the selective excitation of specific phonon modes through the use of a pulse train technique is shown.},

We discuss in detail how to implement the method and how to compute various physical quantities. In particular, we show how to extend the method to study averages of off-diagonal quantities in an occupation-number representation. To assess the accuracy of our procedure, we apply it to free fermions in one dimension and compare with exact results. We then study a model of spinless interacting fermions and obtain the expected phase structure and behavior of correlation functions. We also consider the extended Hubbard model at various points in its phase diagram and study the behavior of spin-density, charge-density, and pairing correlation functions. We then study the Gross-Neveu model and show how the behavior depends on the number of fermion flavors. Finally, we consider an electron-phonon model and study its behavior both in the one-particle polaron sector and in the half-filled-band case. Along the way we show pictures of the ground-state configurations that give physical insight into the properties of the systems, like charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and superconducting states, "fractional charges," and solitons. We conclude by comparing our method with other methods and discuss the possibility of extending it to higher dimensions.},

	abstract = {In this paper is described a model for polaron motion which incorporates, in simplified form, the principal physical features of the problem. The (crystalline) medium, within which a single excess electron (or hole) is contained, is taken to be a one-dimensional molecular crystal, consisting of diatomic molecular sites; each site possesses a single vibrational degree of freedom, represented by the deviation, xn, of its internuclear separation from equilibrium. The motion of the electron in this medium is treated by a tight-binding approach, in which the wave function is represented as a superposition of local ?molecular? functions, ϕ(r ? na, xn). In line with the xn dependence of the δ's, it is also assumed that the ?local? electronic energy, En, (which, in the conventional tight-binding theory, has one and the same value for all sites) depends (linearly) on xn. This dependence gives rise to electron-lattice interaction; alternatively, it may be regarded as removing the electronic translational degeneracy, characteristic of the undistorted crystal, and thereby providing the possibility for electron trapping. On the basis of the above-described model, the zeroth order adiabatic treatment of the polaron problem is developed. For values of the parameters such that the linear dimension of the polaron is large compared to a lattice spacing (?large? polaron), an exact solution is obtained; the correspondence between it and Pekar's zeroth-order solution is established. The conditions under which the size of the polaron becomes comparable to a lattice spacing (?small? polaron) are discussed. Finally, by way of exhibiting the relationship of the molecular-crystal concept to the real situation, a description is given of an alternate molecular-crystal model which, in the case of the large polaron, is completely equivalent to the continuum-polarization model of conventional polaron theory.},

	abstract = {In mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics few but important degrees of freedom of a molecular system are modeled quantum mechanically while the remaining degrees of freedom are treated within the classical approximation. Such models can be systematically derived as a first-order approximation to the partial Wigner transform of the quantum Liouville-von Neumann equation. The resulting adiabatic quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) can be decomposed into three individual propagators by means of a Trotter splitting: (1) phase oscillations of the coherences resulting from the time evolution of the quantum-mechanical subsystem, (2) exchange of densities and coherences reflecting non adiabaticeffects in quantum-classical dynamics, and (3) classical Liouvillian transport of densities and coherences along adiabatic potential energy surfaces or arithmetic means thereof. A novel stochastic implementation of the QCLE is proposed in the present work. In order to substantially improve the traditional algorithm based on surface hopping trajectories [J. C. Tully, J. Chem. Phys. 93, 1061 (1990)], we model the evolution of densities and coherences by a set of surface hopping Gaussian phase-space packets (GPPs) with variable width and with adjustable real or complex amplitudes, respectively. The dense sampling of phase space offers two main advantages over other numerical schemes to solve the QCLE. First, it allows us to perform a quantum-classical simulation employing a constant number of particles; i.e., the generation of new trajectories at each surface hop is avoided. Second, the effect of nonlocal operators on the exchange of densities and coherences can be treated beyond the momentum jump approximation. For the example of a single avoided crossing we demonstrate that convergence towards fully quantum-mechanical dynamics is much faster for surface hopping GPPs than for trajectory-based methods. For dual avoided crossings the Gaussian-based dynamics correctly reproduces the quantum-mechanical result even when trajectory-based methods not accounting for the transport of coherences fail qualitatively.},

For condensed phase and complex systems, where quantum dynamics is difficult to carry out, approximations must often be made to compute these functions. We present a general scheme for the computation of correlation functions, which preserves the full quantum equilibrium structure of the system and approximates the time evolution with quantum-classical Liouville dynamics.

Considering the strong coupling/high temperature limit, a relationship is obtained at short time between the rate of electronic coherence loss and the electronic dephasing rate characteristic of a classical bath. Using this relationship, we clarify the origin of the decay of the NOPF. In the same limit, we also reproduce an earlier relationship between the electronic decoherence time and a solvation relaxation time. Finally, we point out that, for the spin-boson model, the exact quantum mechanical description of electronic dephasing is reproduced by mixed quantum/classical methods if a Gaussian distribution of quantum fluctuations around each classical phase space point is introduced. That spatial distribution of quantum fluctuations is functionally the same as that appearing in the Feynman-Kleinert variational local harmonic approximation, and also that implemented in existing classical trajectory-based estimates of coherence dissipation times.},

We find that none of the methods can give a reliable picture of the role of the environment in photosynthetic EET. In particular the popular secular approximation (or the corresponding Lindblad equation) produces anomalous behavior in the incoherent transfer region leading to overestimation of the contribution of environment-assisted transfer. The full Redfield expression on the other hand produces environment-independent dynamics in the large reorganization energy region.

In the regime of coherent wavelike motion, the equation predicts several times longer lifetime of electronic coherence between chromophores than does the conventional Redfield equation. Furthermore, we show quantum coherent motion can be observed even when reorganization energy is large in comparison to intersite electronic coupling (the Forster incoherent regime). In the region of small reorganization energy, slow fluctuation sustains longer-lived coherent oscillation, whereas the Markov approximation in the Redfield framework causes infinitely fast fluctuation and then collapses the quantum coherence. In the region of large reorganization energy, sluggish dissipation of reorganization energy increases the time electronic excitation stays above an energy barrier separating chromophores and thus prolongs delocalization over the chromophores.},

The resultant expression coincides with the time-convolutionless quantum master equation derived from the second-order perturbative approximation, which is also equivalent to a generalized Redfield equation. This agreement occurs because, in the nonperturbative case, the relaxation operators arise from the higher-order system?bath interaction that can be incorporated into the reduced density matrix as the influence operator; while the second-order interaction remains as a relaxation operator in the equation of motion. While the equation describes the exact dynamics of the density matrix beyond weak system?bath interactions, it does not have the capability to calculate nonlinear response functions appropriately. This is because the equation cannot describe memory effects which straddle the external system interactions due to the reduced description of the bath. To illustrate this point, we have calculated the third-order two-dimensional (2D) spectra for a two-level system from the present approach and the hierarchically coupled equations approach that can handle quantal system?bath coherence thanks to its hierarchical formalism. The numerical demonstration clearly indicates the lack of the system?bath correlation in the present formalism as fast dephasing profiles of the 2D spectra.},

The method derives from a stochastic modeling of the time-dependent Schro?dinger and master equations for open systems and accounts simultaneously for quantum mechanical branching in the otherwise classical (nuclear) degrees of freedom and loss of coherence within the quantum (electronic) subsystem due to coupling to nuclei. Electronic dynamics in the Hilbert space takes the form of a unitary evolution, intermittent with stochastic decoherence events that are manifested as a localization toward (adiabatic) basis states. Classical particles evolve along a single potential energy surface and can switch surfaces only at the decoherence events. Thus, decoherence provides physical justification of surface hopping, obviating the need for ad hoc surface hopping rules. The method is tested with model problems, showing good agreement with the exact quantum mechanical results and providing an improvement over the most popular surface hopping technique. The method is implemented within real-time time-dependent density functional theory formulated in the Kohn-Sham representation and is applied to carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons.

	abstract = {Recent progress in the theoretical treatment of electronically nonadiabatic processes is discussed. First we discuss the generalized Born?Oppenheimer approximation, which identifies a subset of strongly coupled states, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of adiabatic and diabatic representations of the coupled surfaces and their interactions are considered. Ab initio diabatic representations that do not require tracking geometric phases or calculating singular nonadiabatic nuclear momentum coupling will be presented as one promising approach for characterizing the coupled electronic states of polyatomic photochemical systems. Such representations can be accomplished by methods based on functionals of the adiabatic electronic density matrix and the identification of reference orbitals for use in an overlap criterion. Next, four approaches to calculating or modeling electronically nonadiabatic dynamics are discussed: (1) accurate quantum mechanical scattering calculations, (2) approximate wave packet methods, (3) surface hopping, and (4) self-consistent-potential semiclassical approaches. The last two of these are particularly useful for polyatomic photochemistry, and recent refinements of these approaches will be discussed. For example, considerable progress has been achieved in making the surface hopping method more applicable to the study of systems with weakly coupled electronic states. This includes introducing uncertainty principle considerations to alleviate the problem of classically forbidden surface hops and the development of an efficient sampling algorithm for low-probability events. A topic whose central importance in a number of quantum mechanical fields is becoming more widely appreciated is the introduction of decoherence into the quantal degrees of freedom to account for the effect of the classical treatment on the other degrees of freedom, and we discuss how the introduction of such decoherence into a self-consistent-potential approximation leads to a reasonably accurate but very practical trajectory method for electronically nonadiabatic processes. Finally, the performances of several dynamical methods for Landau?Zener-type and Rosen?Zener?Demkov-type reactive scattering problems are compared.},

	abstract = {The mixed quantum-classical surface hopping method is applied to the vibrational predissociation of methanol dimer, and the results are compared to more exact quantum calculations. Utilizing the vibrational SCF basis, the predissociation problem is cast into a curve crossing problem between dissociative and quasibound surfaces with different vibrational character. The varied features of the dissociative surfaces, arising from the large amplitude OH torsion, generate rich predissociation dynamics. The fewest switches surface hopping algorithm of Tully [J. Chem. Phys. 93, 1061 (1990)] is applied to both diabatic and adiabatic representations. The comparison affords new insight into the criterion for selecting the suitable representation. The adiabatic method's difficulty with low energy trajectories is highlighted. In the normal crossing case, the diabatic calculations yield good results, albeit showing its limitation in situations where tunneling is important. The quadratic scaling of the rates on coupling strength is confirmed. An interesting resonance behavior is identified and is dealt with using a simple decoherence scheme. For low lying dissociative surfaces that do not cross the quasibound surface, the diabatic method tends to overestimate the predissociation rate whereas the adiabatic method is qualitatively correct. Analysis reveals the major culprits involve Rabi-like oscillation, treatment of classically forbidden hops, and overcoherence. Improvements of the surface hopping results are achieved by adopting a few changes to the original surface hopping algorithms.},

The most advanced ideas in the field involve the use of molecules as individual logic or memory units and are broadly based on using the quantum state space of the molecule. Current work in molecular electronics usually addresses molecular junction transport, where the molecule acts as a barrier for incoming electrons: This is the fundamental Landauer idea of "conduction as scattering" generalized to molecular junction structures. Another point of view in terms of superexchange as a guiding mechanism for coherent electron transfer through the molecular bridge is discussed. Molecules generally exhibit relatively strong vibronic coupling. The last section of this overview focuses on vibronic effects, including inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, hysteresis in junction charge transport, and negative differential resistance in molecular transport junctions.},

Mid-infrared optical pulses excite localized molecular vibrations in ET-F2TCNQ, a prototypical one-dimensional Mott-insulator. A broadband ultrafast probe interrogates the resulting optical spectrum between THz and visible frequencies. A red-shifted charge-transfer resonance is observed, consistent with a time-averaged reduction of the electronic correlation strength U. Secondly, a sideband manifold inside of the Mott-gap appears, resulting from a periodically modulated U. The response is compared to computations based on a quantum-modulated dynamic Hubbard model.

By studying relaxation dynamics in a wide range of dynamical regimes, typical of charge and energy transfer, we show that MF-GQME provides a much higher accuracy than a direct application of mean field theory. In addition, these increases in accuracy are accompanied by computational speed-ups of between one and two orders of magnitude that become larger as the system becomes more nonadiabatic. This combination of quantum-classical theory and master equation techniques thus makes it possible to obtain the accuracy of much more computationally expensive approaches at a cost lower than even mean field dynamics, providing the ability to treat the quantum dynamics of atomistic condensed phase systems for long times.},

The algorithm is based on a Trotter decomposition of the quantum-classical propagator, in conjunction with Monte Carlo sampling of quantum transitions, to yield a surface-hopping representation of the dynamics. An expression for the nonadiabatic propagator that is responsible for quantum transitions and associated bath momentum changes is derived in a form that is convenient for Monte Carlo sampling and exactly conserves the total energy of the system in individual trajectories. The expectation values of operators or quantum correlation functions can be evaluated by initial sampling of quantum states and use of quantum-classical Liouville dynamics for the time evolution. The algorithm is tested by calculations on the spin-boson model, for which exact quantum results are available, and is shown to reproduce the exact results for stronger nonadiabatic coupling and much longer times using fewer trajectories than other schemes for simulating quantum-classical Liouville dynamics.},

	abstract = {We introduce the real-time density matrix embedding theory (DMET), a dynamical quantum embedding theory for computing non-equilibrium electron dynamics. As in the previously developed static DMET, real-time DMET partitions the system into an impurity corresponding to the region of interest coupled to the surrounding environment. The environment is efficiently represented by a quantum bath of the same size as the impurity. The equations of motion of the coupled impurity and bath embedding problem are then derived using the time-dependent variational principle. The accuracy of real-time DMET is benchmarked through comparisons with reference time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations for a variety of quantum quenches in the single impurity Anderson model (SIAM). We find that real-time DMET is able to correctly capture the non-trivial behavior in the Kondo regime of the SIAM and is able to simulate system sizes beyond those that can be treated by time-dependent DMRG. Our results demonstrate that real-time DMET is an efficient method well suited for the simulation of non-equilibrium electron dynamics in which strong electron correlation plays an important role.},

	abstract = {Mixed quantum/classical (MQC) molecular dynamics simulation has become the method of choice for simulating the dynamics of quantum mechanical objects that interact with condensed-phase systems. There are many MQC algorithms available, however, and in cases where nonadiabatic coupling is important, different algorithms may lead to different results. Thus, it has been difficult to reach definitive conclusions about relaxation dynamics using nonadiabatic MQC methods because one is never certain whether any given algorithm includes enough of the necessary physics. In this paper, we explore the physics underlying different nonadiabatic MQC algorithms by comparing and contrasting the excited-state relaxation dynamics of the prototypical condensed-phase MQC system, the hydrated electron, calculated using different algorithms, including: fewest-switches surface hopping, stationary-phase surface hopping, and mean-field dynamics with surface hopping. We also describe in detail how a new nonadiabatic algorithm, mean-field dynamics with stochastic decoherence (MF-SD), is to be implemented for condensed-phase problems, and we apply MF-SD to the excited-state relaxation of the hydrated electron. Our discussion emphasizes the different ways quantum decoherence is treated in each algorithm and the resulting implications for hydrated-electron relaxation dynamics. We find that for three MQC methods that use Tully's fewest-switches criterion to determine surface hopping probabilities, the excited-state lifetime of the electron is the same. Moreover, the nonequilibrium solvent response function of the excited hydrated electron is the same with all of the nonadiabatic MQC algorithms discussed here, so that all of the algorithms would produce similar agreement with experiment. Despite the identical solvent response predicted by each MQC algorithm, we find that MF-SD allows much more mixing of multiple basis states into the quantum wave function than do other methods. This leads to an excited-state lifetime that is longer with MF-SD than with any method that incorporates nonadiabatic effects with the fewest-switches surface hopping criterion.},

The data revealed long-lasting coherence between two electronic states that are formed by mixing of the bacteriopheophytin and accessory bacteriochlorophyll excited states. This coherence can only be explained by strong correlation between the protein-induced fluctuations in the transition energy of neighboring chromophores. Our results suggest that correlated protein environments preserve electronic coherence in photosynthetic complexes and allow the excitation to move coherently in space, enabling highly efficient energy harvesting and trapping in photosynthesis.},

As the coupling to the electrodes increases, higher-order tunnelling and correlated electron motion give rise to new phenomena, including the Kondo resonance. To date, all of the studies of Kondo phenomena in quantum dots have been performed on systems where precise control over the spin degrees of freedom is difficult. Molecules incorporating transition-metal atoms provide powerful new systems in this regard, because the spin and orbital degrees of freedom can be controlled through well-defined chemistry. Here we report the observation of the Kondo effect in single-molecule transistors, where an individual divanadium molecule serves as a spin impurity. We find that the Kondo resonance can be tuned reversibly using the gate voltage to alter the charge and spin state of the molecule. The resonance persists at temperatures up to 30 K and when the energy separation between the molecular state and the Fermi level of the metal exceeds 100 meV.},

Special attention is paid to the role of superexchange and sequential hopping at lower temperatures in symmetric donor-bridge-acceptor systems. In contrast to previous approximate studies, superexchange turns out to play a significant role only for extremely high-lying bridges where the transfer is basically frozen or for extremely low temperatures where for weaker dissipation a description in terms of rate constants is no longer feasible. For bridges with increasing length an algebraic decrease of the yield is found for short as well as for long bridges.

In particular the validity and limitations of Tully?s surface-hopping (SH) model [J. Chem. Phys. 93, 1061 (1990)] is investigated in the case of photoinduced relaxation processes which are triggered by a multidimensional conical intersection (or avoided crossing) of two potential-energysurfaces. Detailed numerical studies are presented, adopting (i) a three-mode model of the S 2 ?S 1 internal-conversion process in pyrazine, (ii) a multimode model of ultrafast intramolecular electron-transfer, (iii) a model exhibiting nonadiabatic photoisomerization dynamics, and (iv) various spin-boson-type models with an Ohmic bath for the description of electron-transfer in solution. The SH simulations are compared to exact quantum-mechanical calculations as well as to results obtained by an alternative mixed quantum-classical description, that is, the self-consistent classical-path method. In all cases, the SH data are shown to reproduce the quantum results at least qualitatively; in some cases the SH results are in quantitative agreement with the complex electronic and vibrational relaxation dynamics exhibited by the quantum calculations. Depending on the physical situation under consideration, either the SH or the self-consistent classical-path method was found to be superior. The characteristic features of a mixed quantum-classical description of photoinduced bound-state dynamics (e.g., the start of the trajectories on a diabatic electronic potential-energysurface, high chance of a trajectory undergoing multiple electronic transitions) as well as the specific problems of the SH approach are discussed in some detail. In particular, the focus is on the ability of a method to account for the branching of trajectories, to correctly describe the electronic phase coherence and the vibrational motion on coupled potential-energysurfaces, and to obey the principle of microreversibility. Furthermore, an alternative way to handle classically forbidden electronic transitions is proposed, which is shown to lead to significantly better results than the usual procedure.},

For the spin-boson model the present implementation of quantum-classical dynamics is exact and the results of our surface-hopping simulations are in accord with previous numerically exact results for this model.},

Journals only publish new results, conferences only invite speakers to report new phenomena, and agencies only fund scientists to do new physics. Today's physics is old hat by tomorrow. Students want to learn new material, and textbooks must be modified to keep up with the times. The early chapters in this book teach the techniques of many-body theory. They are largely unchanged in format. The later chapters apply the techniques to specific problems. The third edition increases the number of applications. New sections have been added, while old sections have been modified to include recent applications. The previous editions were set in type using pre-computer technology. No computer file existed of the prior editions. The publisher scanned the second edition and gave me a disk with the contents. This scan recorded the words accurately and scrambled the equations into unintelligible form. So I retyped the equations using LaTeX. Although tedious, it allowed me to correct the infinite numbers of typographical errors in the previous edition. The earlier typesetting methods did not permit such corrections. The entire book was edited sentence-by sentence. Most old sections of the book were shortened by editing sentences and paragraphs.},

A transition from coherent to purely incoherent relaxation was observed for the spin correlation function. The time correlation functions and the location of the coherent-incoherent boundary on the T-? plane are well described by the noninteracting-blip approximation. In the deep-tunneling limit of large ?, low T, and high bath frequency, the system relaxes exponentially, with its relaxation time constant following a power-law temperature dependence, in accord with perturbation theory. At higher T and low bath frequency, the relaxation time crosses over to a classical Arrhenius temperature dependence, reflecting the onset of activated processes. For a narrow region within 1/2{\textbackslash}textless?{\textbackslash}textless1, numerical results suggest that the system undergoes incoherent relaxation, with a short-time exponential decay, followed by a long-time tail of the power-law type.

Truncation of the expansion at the quadratic terms allows mapping of a many-body environment onto an effective harmonic model with the same force autocorrelation function, recovering the conventional linear response limit. It is shown that the latter becomes exact in the thermodynamic limit if the bath consists of independent modes coupled to the system via coefficients that scale appropriately with the size of the bath. Low-order correction terms to the linear response approximation are found to be given by multitime correlation functions of the force exerted by the bath on the system. Within a classical approximation, such correction terms can be obtained from molecular dynamics calculations and incorporated in the path integral, which can be evaluated by means of iterative procedures. Numerical calculations on an intrinsically nonlinear bath of two-level systems confirm the above behaviors and indicate that the deviations from the linear response approximation are more significant at low temperatures where quantum mechanical effects play an important role to the bath dynamics.},

Exploiting the finite span of nonlocal influence functional interactions characteristic of broad condensed phase spectra leads to an iterative scheme for calculating the path integral over arbitrary time lengths.

In a recent Letter [Chem. Phys. Lett. 221, 482 (1994)], we demonstrated that the range of the nonlocal interactions is finite even at zero temperature, such that the nonlocal kernel extends over only a few time steps if the path integral is expressed in terms of accurate quasiadiabatic propagators. This feature arises from disruption of phase coherence in macroscopic environments and leads to Markovian dynamics for an augmented reduced density tensor, permitting iterative time evolution schemes. In the present paper we analyze the structure and properties of the relevant tensor propagator. Specifically, we show that the tensor multiplication scheme rigorously conserves the trace of the reduced density matrix, and that in cases of short?range nonlocality it leads to Redfield?type equations which are correct to all orders in perturbation theory and which take into account memory effects. We also argue that a simple eigenvector analysis reveals (without actual iteration) the nature of the dynamics and of the equilibrium state, and directly yields quantum reaction or relaxation rates.},

The method provides a generalization of previous interpolative schemes which have been applied to the purely electronic case extensively.

The results obtained with the interpolative ansatz are in good agreement with existing data from Numerical Renormalization Group calculations.

	abstract = {Generalized master equations provide a concise formalism for studying reduced population dynamics. Usually, these master equations require a perturbative expansion of the memory kernels governing the dynamics; in order to prevent divergences, these expansions must be resummed. Resummation techniques of perturbation series are ubiquitous in physics, but they have not been readily studied for the time-dependent memory kernels used in generalized master equations. In this paper, we present a comparison of different resummation techniques for such memory kernels up to fourth order. We study specifically the spin-boson Hamiltonian as a model system bath Hamiltonian, treating the diabatic coupling between the two states as a perturbation. A novel derivation of the fourth-order memory kernel for the spin-boson problem is presented; then, the second- and fourth-order kernels are evaluated numerically for a variety of spin-boson parameter regimes. We find that resumming the kernels through fourth order using a Padé approximant results in divergent populations in the strong electronic coupling regime due to a singularity introduced by the nature of the resummation, and thus recommend a non-divergent exponential resummation (the "Landau-Zener resummation" of previous work). The inclusion of fourth-order effects in a Landau-Zener-resummed kernel is shown to improve both the dephasing rate and the obedience of detailed balance over simpler prescriptions like the non-interacting blip approximation, showing a relatively quick convergence on the exact answer. The results suggest that including higher-order contributions to the memory kernel of a generalized master equation and performing an appropriate resummation can provide a numerically-exact solution to system-bath dynamics for a general spectral density, opening the way to a new class of methods for treating system-bath dynamics.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the effect of electron-phonon interactions in molecular transistors, including both quantal and classical limits and we study both equilibrated and out of equilibrium phonons. We present detailed results for conductance, noise and phonon distribution in two regimes. One involves temperatures large as compared to the rate of electronic transitions on and off the dot; in this limit our approach yields classical rate equations, which are solved numerically for a wide range of parameters. The other regime is that of low temperatures and weak electron-phonon coupling where a perturbative approximation in the Keldysh formulation can be applied. The interplay between the phonon-induced renormalization of the density of states on the quantum dot and the phonon-induced renormalization of the dot-lead coupling is found to be important. Whether or not the phonons are able to equilibrate in a time rapid compared to the transit time of an electron through the dot is found to affect the conductance. Observable signatures of phonon equilibration are presented. We also discuss the nature of the low-T to high-T crossover.},

The approach consists of propagation of weak-coupling Redfield-like equations for the high-frequency bath degrees of freedom only, while the low-frequency bath modes are dynamically arrested but statistically sampled. We examine the improvements afforded by this approximation by comparing with exact results for the spin-boson model over a wide range of parameter space. We further generalize the method to multi-site models and compare with exact results for a model of the Fenna?Matthews?Olson complex. The results from the method are found to dramatically improve Redfield dynamics in highly non-Markovian regimes, at a similar computational cost. Relaxation of the mode-freezing approximation via classical (Ehrenfest) evolution of the low-frequency modes results in a dynamical hybrid method. We find that this Redfield-based dynamical hybrid approach, which is computationally more expensive than bare Redfield dynamics, yields only a marginal improvement over the simpler approximation of complete mode arrest.},

To illustrate the properties of the current approach, we focus on the spin-boson model and limit our attention to the use of a simple and inexpensive quasi-classical dynamics, given by the Ehrenfest method, for the calculation of the auxiliary kernels. For the first time, we provide a detailed analysis of the dependence of the properties of the memory kernels obtained via different projection operators, namely, the thermal (Redfield-type) and population based (NIBA-type) projection operators. We further elucidate the conditions that lead to short-lived memory kernels and the regions of parameter space to which this program is best suited. Via a thorough analysis of the different closures available for the auxiliary kernels and the convergence properties of the self-consistently extracted memory kernel, we identify the mechanisms whereby the current approach leads to a significant improvement over the direct usage of standard semi- and quasi-classical dynamics.},

Representing this equation in the mapping basis leads to a continuous description of discrete quantum states of the subsystem and may provide an alternate route to the construction of simulation schemes. In the mapping basis the quantum-classical Liouville equation consists of a Poisson bracket contribution and a more complex term. By transforming the evolution equation, term-by-term, back to the subsystem basis, the complex term (excess coupling term) is identified as being due to a fraction of the back reaction of the quantum subsystem on its environment. A simple approximation to quantum-classical Liouville dynamics in the mapping basis is obtained by retaining only the Poisson bracket contribution. This approximate mapping form of the quantum-classical Liouville equation can be simulated easily by Newtonian trajectories. We provide an analysis of the effects of neglecting the presence of the excess coupling term on the expectation values of various types of observables. Calculations are carried out on nonadiabatic population and quantum coherence dynamics for curve crossing models. For these observables, the effects of the excess coupling term enter indirectly in the computation and good estimates are obtained with the simplified propagation.},

	abstract = {Within the fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) formulation, a swarm of independent trajectories is propagated and the equations of motion for the quantum coefficients are evolved coherently along each independent nuclear trajectory. That is, the phase factors, or quantum amplitudes, are retained. At a region of strong coupling, a trajectory can branch into multiple wavepackets. Directly following a hop, the two wavepackets remain in a region of nonadiabatic coupling and continue exchanging population. After these wavepackets have sufficiently separated in phase space, they should begin to evolve independently from one another, the process known as decoherence. Decoherence is not accounted for in the standard surface hopping algorithm and leads to internal inconsistency. FSSH is designed to ensure that at any time, the fraction of classical trajectories evolving on each quantum state is equal to the average quantum probability for that state. However, in many systems this internal consistency requirement is violated. Treating decoherence is an inherent problem that can be addressed by implementing some form of decoherence correction to the standard FSSH algorithm. In this study, we have implemented two forms of the instantaneous decoherence procedure where coefficients are reinitialized following hops. We also test the energy-based decoherence correction (EDC) scheme proposed by Granucci et al. and a related version where the form of the decoherence time is taken from Truhlar's Coherent Switching with Decay of Mixing method. The sensitivity of the EDC results to changes in parameters is also evaluated. The application of these computationally inexpensive ad hoc methods is demonstrated in the simulation of nonradiative relaxation in two conjugated oligomer systems, specifically poly-phenylene vinylene and poly-phenylene ethynylene. We find that methods that have been used successfully for treating small systems do not necessarily translate to large polyatomic systems and their success depends on the particular system under study.},

For a Markovian bath, we readily demonstrate the validity of a steady-state heat exchange fluctuation theorem. In the non-Markovian limit a ?weaker? symmetry relation generally holds, a general outcome of microreversibility. We discuss the reduction of this symmetry relation to the universal steady-state fluctuation theorem. Using the cumulant generating function, an analytic expression for the heat current is obtained. Our results establish the validity of the steady-state heat exchange fluctuation theorem in quantum systems with strong system-bath interactions.

	abstract = {This text provides a uniform and consistent approach to diversified problems encountered in the study of dynamical processes in condensed phase molecular systems. Given the broad interdisciplinary aspect of this subject, the book focuses on three themes: coverage of needed background material, in-depth introduction of methodologies, and analysis of several key applications. The uniform approach and common language used in all discussions help to develop general understanding and insight on condensed phases chemical dynamics. The applications discussed are among the most fundamental processes that underlie physical, chemical and biological phenomena in complex systems. The first part of the book starts with a general review of basic mathematical and physical methods (Chapter 1) and a few introductory chapters on quantum dynamics (Chapter 2), interaction of radiation and matter (Chapter 3) and basic properties of solids (chapter 4) and liquids (Chapter 5). In the second part the text embarks on a broad coverage of the main methodological approaches. The central role of classical and quantum time correlation functions is emphasized in Chapter 6. The presentation of dynamical phenomena in complex systems as stochastic processes is discussed in Chapters 7 and 8. The basic theory of quantum relaxation phenomena is developed in Chapter 9, and carried on in Chapter 10 which introduces the density operator, its quantum evolution in Liouville space, and the concept of reduced equation of motions. The methodological part concludes with a discussion of linear response theory in Chapter 11, and of the spin-boson model in chapter 12. The third part of the book applies the methodologies introduced earlier to several fundamental processes that underlie much of the dynamical behaviour of condensed phase molecular systems. Vibrational relaxation and vibrational energy transfer (Chapter 13), Barrier crossing and diffusion controlled reactions (Chapter 14), solvation dynamics (Chapter 15), electron transfer in bulk solvents (Chapter 16) and at electrodes/electrolyte and metal/molecule/metal junctions (Chapter 17), and several processes pertaining to molecular spectroscopy in condensed phases (Chapter 18) are the main subjects discussed in this part.},

	abstract = {Photosynthetic antenna complexes capture and concentrate solar radiation by transferring the excitation to the reaction center that stores energy from the photon in chemical bonds. This process occurs with near-perfect quantum efficiency. Recent experiments at cryogenic temperatures have revealed that coherent energy transfer–a wave-like transfer mechanism–occurs in many photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes. Using the Fenna-Matthews-Olson antenna complex (FMO) as a model system, theoretical studies incorporating both incoherent and coherent transfer as well as thermal dephasing predict that environmentally assisted quantum transfer efficiency peaks near physiological temperature; these studies also show that this mechanism simultaneously improves the robustness of the energy transfer process. This theory requires long-lived quantum coherence at room temperature, which never has been observed in FMO. Here we present evidence that quantum coherence survives in FMO at physiological temperature for at least 300 fs, long enough to impact biological energy transport. These data prove that the wave-like energy transfer process discovered at 77 K is directly relevant to biological function. Microscopically, we attribute this long coherence lifetime to correlated motions within the protein matrix encapsulating the chromophores, and we find that the degree of protection afforded by the protein appears constant between 77 K and 277 K. The protein shapes the energy landscape and mediates an efficient energy transfer despite thermal fluctuations.},

Besides the collapse of the electronic gap, the sudden excitation of the charge density wave (CDW) mode results in periodic oscillations of the electronic states. We employ time resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to monitor the rich dynamics of electrons and phonons during the relaxation toward equilibrium. The qualitative difference between the oscillatory dynamics of the CDW and the monotonic recovery of the electronic gap proves that 1T-TaS 2 is indeed a Mott insulator. Moreover the quasi-instantaneous build-up of mid gap states is in contrast with the retarded response expected from a Peierls insulating phase. Interestingly, the photoinduced electronic states in the midgap spectral region display a weak resonance that is reminiscent of a quasiparticle peak.},

For systems where nonadiabatic dynamics and electronic relaxation are present, preliminary results show that our method produces spectra in better agreement with the results of exact quantum dynamics calculations than spectra obtained using the standard ground-state Kubo formalism. As such, our proposed surface hopping approach should find immediate use for modeling condensed phase spectra, especially for expensive calculations using ab initio potential energy surfaces.},

	abstract = {A stochastic mean-field(SMF) approach to nonadiabatic molecular simulations is introduced. Based on the quantum-classical mean-field approximation, SMF extents the classical model of the environment to incorporate its quantum properties. SMF differs from the ordinary mean-field method by the presence of additional terms in the Schrödinger equation that are due to the system-environment interaction. SMF resolves the two major drawbacks of mixed quantum-classical models. First, decoherence effects in the quantum subsystem are rigorously included. Present in all open systems, decoherence is crucial for nonadiabatic transitions taking place in condensed media. Second, the correct branching of the quantum-classical trajectories is achieved. In earlier approaches, the correct branching of the trajectories was attained via ad hoc surface hopping procedures, which experienced the hop rejection problem and could produce unfavorable classical trajectories in regions of nonadiabatic transitions depending on the quantum basis. It is shown that the correct branching of the trajectories is a direct consequence of decoherence. It is argued that the hop rejection problem disappears in SMF. The decoherence operator is discussed in detail, and the properties of the SMF method are illustrated with model simulations.},

However, since quantum transitions are inherently nonadiabatic processes, the adiabatic approximation underlying the classical equations of motion does not hold in the regions where quantum transitions take place, and the restriction to classical trajectories for adiabatic quantum states is an approximation. Alternatives which employ classical paths that account more fully for nonadiabaticity can be computationally expensive and algorithmically complicated. Here, we propose a new method, which combines the surface hopping idea with the mean-field approximation for classical paths. Applied to three test systems, the method is shown to outperform the methods based on an adiabatic force without significant extra effort. This makes it an appealing alternative for modeling complex quantum?classical processes.},

Next we discuss the physical implications of the standard Redfield equations when perturbation theory is carried out to fourth order. We then apply similar techniques to the study of the spin-boson problem. Here, various methods of aproximate resummation are used to calculate the mean position of a tunneling particle coupled to a fluctuating quantum environment.

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore in detail the way in which quantum decoherence is treated in different mixed quantum?classical molecular dynamics algorithms. The quantum decoherence time proves to be a key ingredient in the production of accurate nonadiabatic dynamics from computer simulations. Based on a short time expansion to a semiclassical golden rule expression due to Neria and Nitzan [J. Chem. Phys. 99, 1109 (1993)], we develop a new computationally efficient method for estimating the decay of quantum coherence in condensed phase molecular simulations. Using the hydrated electron as an example, application of this method finds that quantum decoherence times are on the order of a few femtoseconds for condensed phase chemical systems and that they play a direct role in determining nonadiabatictransition rates. The decay of quantum coherence for the solvated electron is found to take ?50\% longer in D2O than in H2O, providing a rationalization for a long standing puzzle concerning the lack of experimentally observed isotope effect on the nonadiabatictransition rate: Although the nonadiabatic coupling is smaller in D2O due to smaller nuclear velocities, the smaller coupling in D2O adds coherently for a longer time than in H2O, leading to nearly identical nonadiabatictransition rates. The implications of this isotope dependence of the nonadiabatictransition rate on changes in the quantum decoherence time for electron transfer and other important chemical reactions are discussed.},

	abstract = {The development of efficient theoretical methods for describing electron transfer (ET) reactions in condensed phases is important for a variety of chemical and biological applications. Previously, dynamical dielectric continuum theory was used to derive Langevin equations for a single collective solvent coordinate describing ET in a polar solvent. In this theory, the parameters are directly related to the physical properties of the system and can be determined from experimental data or explicit molecular dynamics simulations. Herein, we combine these Langevin equations with surface hopping nonadiabatic dynamics methods to calculate the rate constants for thermal ET reactions in polar solvents for a wide range of electronic couplings and reaction free energies. Comparison of explicit and implicit solvent calculations illustrates that the mapping from explicit to implicit solvent models is valid even for solvents exhibiting complex relaxation behavior with multiple relaxation time scales and a short-time inertial response. The rate constants calculated for implicit solvent models with a single solvent relaxation time scale corresponding to water, acetonitrile, and methanol agree well with analytical theories in the Golden rule and solvent-controlled regimes, as well as in the intermediate regime. The implicit solvent models with two relaxation time scales are in qualitative agreement with the analytical theories but quantitatively overestimate the rate constants compared to these theories. Analysis of these simulations elucidates the importance of multiple relaxation time scales and the inertial component of the solvent response, as well as potential shortcomings of the analytical theories based on single time scale solvent relaxation models. This implicit solvent approach will enable the simulation of a wide range of ET reactions via the stochastic dynamics of a single collective solvent coordinate with parameters that are relevant to experimentally accessible systems.},

One such phenomenon is the highly correlated electronic state responsible for the Kondo effect, manifested here as a "Kondo resonance" in the conductance. Because the Kondo effect results from strong electron-electron interactions, it is not captured by the usual quantum chemistry approaches traditionally applied to understand chemical electron transfer. In this review, we will discuss the origins and phenomenology of Kondo resonances observed in single-molecule devices, focusing primarily on the spin-1/2 Kondo state arising from a single unpaired electron. We explore the rich physical system of a single-molecule device, which offers a unique spectroscopic tool for investigating the interplay of emergent Kondo behavior and such properties as molecular orbital transitions and vibrational modes. We will additionally address more exotic systems, such as higher spin states in the Kondo regime, and we will review recent experimental advances in the ability to manipulate and exert control over these nanoscale devices.},

Phys. 119, 12045 (2003)] we proposed a new approach to calculating the memory kernel, in the case of arbitrary system-bath coupling. Within this approach, the memory kernel is obtained by solving a set of two integral equations, which requires a new type of two-time system-dependent bath correlation functions as input. In the present paper, we consider the application of the linearized semiclassical (LSC) approximation for calculating those correlation functions, and subsequently the memory kernel. The new approach is tested on a benchmark spin-boson model. Application of the LSC approximation for calculating the relatively short-lived memory kernel, followed by a numerically exact solution of the GQME, is found to provide an accurate description of the relaxation dynamics. The success of the proposed LSC-GQME methodology is contrasted with the failure of both the direct application of the LSC approximation and the weak coupling treatment to provide an accurate description of the dynamics, for the same model, except at very short times. The feasibility of the new methodology to anharmonic systems is also demonstrated in the case of a two level system coupled to a chain of Lennard-Jones atoms.},

Specifically, we show that the analog of the Franck-Condon blockade physics is missing in the spin-fermion model. We complement this study by considering the low-temperature quantum adiabatic limit of the dissipative spin-fermion model, with fast tunneling electrons and a slow impurity.

The capability of the approach is demonstrated by comparing semiclassical calculations for a spin?boson model with an Ohmic bath to exact path?integral calculations. It is shown that the semiclassical model nicely reproduces the complex dissipative behavior of the spin?boson model for a large range of model parameters. The validity and accuracy of the semiclassical approach is discussed in some detail. It is shown that the method is essentially based on the assumption of complete randomization of nuclear phases. In particular, the assumption of phase randomization allows one to perform the trace over the bath variables through quasiclassical sampling of the nuclear initial conditions without invoking any further approximation.},

We investigate a system of two solid-state qubits that are coupled via ?(i)z??(j)z type of coupling. This kind of setup is typical for pseudospin solid-state quantum bits such as charge or flux systems. We evaluate decoherence properties and gate quality factors in the presence of a common and two uncorrelated baths coupling to ?z, respectively. We show that at low temperatures, uncorrelated baths do degrade the gate quality more severely. In particular, we show that in the case of a common bath, optimum gate performance of a controlled-PHASE gate can be reached at very low temperatures, because our type of coupling commutes with the coupling to the decoherence, which makes this type of coupling interesting as compared to previously studied proposals with ?(i)y??(j)y coupling. Although less pronounced, this advantage also applies to the controlled-NOT gate.},

The hierarchy equations of motion present one such model and offer a powerful method that remained under-utilized so far due to its considerable computational expense. By exploiting concurrent processing on parallel computers the hierarchy equations of motion can be applied to biological-scale systems. Herein we introduce the quantum dynamics software PHI, that solves the hierarchical equations of motion.

The A-FSSH algorithm was designed to correct the well-known overcoherence problem in traditional FSSH, and thus allow wave packets on different surfaces to separate naturally subject to different forces. As presented earlier, however, the A-FSSH algorithm was restricted to two electronic states. We now extend the method to more than two electronic states and present several new model problems with multiple electronic and nuclear dimensions. Lastly, starting with the quantum Liouville equation, we rederive and implement the new phase correction suggested by Shenvi (Shenvi, N.; Subotnik, J. E.; Yang, W. J. Chem.

	abstract = {We present a new algorithm for mixed quantum-classical dynamics that helps bridge the gap between mean-field (Ehrenfest) and surface-hopping dynamics by defining a natural rate of decoherence. In order to derive this decoherence result, we have expanded the number of independent variables in the usual Ehrenfest routine so that mixed quantum-classical derivatives are now propagated in time alongside the usual Ehrenfest variables. Having done so, we compute a unique rate of decoherence using two independent approaches: (i) by comparing the equations of motion for the joint nuclear-electronic probability density in phase space according to Ehrenfest dynamics versus partial Wigner transform dynamics and (ii) by introducing a frozen Gaussian interpretation of Ehrenfest dynamics which allows nuclear wave packets to separate. The first consequence of this work is a means to rigorously check the accuracy of standard Ehrenfest dynamics. Second, this paper suggests a nonadiabatic dynamics algorithm, whereby the nuclei are propagated on the mean-field (Ehrenfest) potential energy surface and undergo stochastic decoherence events. Our work resembles the surface-hopping algorithm of Schwartz and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 123, 234106 (2005)]–only now without any adjustable parameters. For the case of two electronic states, we present numerical results on the so-called "Tully problems" and emphasize that future numerical benchmarking is still needed.

We furthermore expect that FSSH (with decoherence) will be most robust when nonadiabatic transitions in an adiabatic basis are dictated primarily by derivative couplings that are presumably localized to crossing regions, rather than by small but pervasive off-diagonal force matrix elements. In the end, our results emphasize the strengths of and possibilities for the FSSH algorithm when decoherence is included, while also demonstrating the limitations of the FSSH algorithm and its inherent inability to follow the QCLE exactly.},

In order to simulate the motion of a wave packet as accurately as possible, standard FSSH requires a stochastic sampling of the trajectories over a distribution of initial conditions corresponding, e.g., to the Wigner distribution of the initial quantum wave packet. Although it is well-known that FSSH does not properly account for decoherence effects, there is some confusion in the literature about whether or not this averaging over a distribution of initial conditions can approximate some of the effects of decoherence. In this paper, we not only show that averaging over initial conditions does not generally account for decoherence, but also why it fails to do so. We also show how an apparent improvement in accuracy can be obtained for a fortuitous choice of model problems, even though this improvement is not possible, in general. For a basic set of one-dimensional and two-dimensional examples, we find significantly improved results using our recently introduced augmented FSSH algorithm.},

Two points in particular merit attention. First, we obtain the correct branching ratios when a quantum particle passes through more than one region of nonadiabatic coupling.

Applications to several model problems are presented to show its usefulness: These are the nonadiabaticscattering problems used by Tully to test surface-hopping models, and also the spin?boson model of coupled electronic states in a condensed phase environment.

Starting from an electronic model Hamiltonian, we construct diabatic states in a manifold of single and double excitations with total singlet multiplicity and then develop a multilevel non-Markovian theory of dynamics for electronic populations in the presence of energy level fluctuations. Depending on the energy scales, energy gap fluctuations can either facilitate or hinder interconversion steps that lead to singlet fission.

By use of the formally exact quasiadiabatic-propagator path-integral methodology we study the time-resolved evolution of this interacting and decohering two-qubit system in presence of time-dependent external fields. The quality of the XOR gate operation is monitored by evaluating the four characteristic gate quantifiers: fidelity, purity, the quantum degree, and the entanglement capability of the gate. Two different types of errors for the XOR operation have been modeled, i.e., (i) bit-flip errors and (ii) phase errors. The various quantifiers are systematically investigated vs the strength of the interqubit coupling and vs both, the environmental temperature and the (Ohmic-like) bath-interaction strength. Our main findings are that these four gate quantifiers depend only very weakly on temperature, but are extremely sensitive to the bath-interaction strength. Interestingly enough, however, we find that the XOR gate operation deteriorates only weakly upon decreasing the interqubit coupling strength. This generic case study yields lower bounds on the quality of realistic XOR gate operations.},

	abstract = {Formal theory of a phonon-assisted tunneling between a metal surface with an adsorbate and a metal scanning tip through an adsorbate (i.e., vibrational scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS)) has been presented on the basis of the self-consistent nonequilibrium Keldysh's diagram technique. Within this approach, it is possible to take into account a finite lifetime of vibrational excitation, and the balance between elastic and opening inelastic tunneling channels. The relaxation of the vibrational degrees of freedom is included into the phonon Keldysh?Green function and plays a very important role both in the elastic and the inelastic tunneling through the adsorbate. The tunnel current (the total as well as the inelastic one) is calculated in terms of the one-particle nondiagonal substrate?adsorbate Keldysh?Green's function supplemented with the vibrational lifetime and filling factors of adsorbate orbital and phonons. The general expression of the inelastic tunnel current and conductance via the excitation of phonons is also presented in terms of the phonon occupation number and the phonon damping function in the stationary condition.},

An essential prospect for such quantum simulators is their ability to map out the phase diagram of fundamental many-body model Hamiltonians. However, the results need to be validated first for representative benchmark problems through state-of-the-art numerical methods of quantum many-body theory. Here we present the first ab initio comparison between experiments and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for strongly interacting Bose gases on a lattice for large systems (up to particles). The comparison enables thermometry for the interacting quantum gas and to experimentally determine the finite-temperature phase diagram for bosonic superfluids in an optical lattice, revealing a suppression of the critical temperature as the transition to the Mott insulator is approached.

Firstly, we examine a double-dot interferometer with a penetrating magnetic flux (Aharonov?Bohm phase \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phiv.gif] \{phiv\} ) between the two quantum dots. The differential conductance shows a sharp dip between double resonant peaks, as a function of energy levels in the quantum dots, when the two dots are equivalently coupled to external leads and 0 {\textless} \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phiv.gif] \{phiv\} {\textless} π. The e?ph interaction significantly decreases the dip, reflecting an emission of phonons from one of the quantum dots. This dephasing effect is more prominent under larger bias voltage. Secondly, we study a T-shaped double-dot system in which one of the dots is connected to the external leads (dot 1) and the other is disconnected (dot 2). The differential conductance shows a dip between two resonant peaks, as in the double-dot interferometer. The dip is weakly reduced by an emission of phonons from dot 2. Phonon emission from dot 1 does not result in dephasing and hence does not influence the dip. Therefore the dip of the conductance is more robust against the e?ph interaction in the T-shaped double-dot system than in the double-dot interferometer.},

The system corresponds to an impurity Anderson model in which the conduction band has a Lorentzian density of states of width Delta2. We solved the model using perturbation theory in the Coulomb repulsion U (PTU) up to second order and a slave-boson mean-field approximation (SBMFA). The PTU works surprisingly well near the exactly solvable limit Delta2 -{\textgreater} 0. For fixed U and large enough lambda or small enough Delta2, the Kondo peak in rho(omega) splits into two peaks. This splitting can be understood in terms of weakly interacting quasiparticles. Before the splitting takes place the universal properties of the model in the Kondo regime are lost. Using the SBMFA, simple analytical expressions for the occurrence of split peaks are obtained. For small or moderate Delta2, the side bands of rho(omega) have the form of narrow resonances, that were missed in previous studies using the numerical renormalization group. This technique also has shortcomings for describing properly the split Kondo peaks. As the temperature is increased, the intensity of the split Kondo peaks decreases, but it is not completely suppressed at high temperatures.},

Using Marcus formula as a reference, it is found that mean field theory with system-bath interaction and surface hopping approaches yield fully consistent charge transfer rates in dimers. However, in contrast to the dimer case, incorporating system-bath interaction in the mean field approach results in a completely wrong temperature dependence of charge carrier mobility in larger aggregates. Although the mean field simulation starting from the relaxed geometry of a charged molecule and neglecting system-bath interaction can reproduce thermally activated transport, it is not able to characterize properly the role of additional nonlocal electron-phonon couplings. Our study reveals that the mean field theory must be used with caution when studying charge transport in the hopping regime of organic semiconductors, where the surface hopping approach is generally superior.},

In this "dispersed polaron" method the fluctuations of the protein and the electron carriers are projected as effective normal modes onto an appropriate reaction coordinate and used to evaluate the quantum mechanical rate constant. The simulations, based on the crystallographic structure of the reaction center from Rhodopseudomonas viridis, focus on electron transfer from a bacteriopheophytin to a quinone and the subsequent back-reaction. The rates of both of these reactions are almost independent of temperature or even increase with decreasing temperature. The simulations reproduce this unusual temperature dependence in a qualitative way, without the use of adjustable parameters for the protein's Franck-Condon factors. The observed dependence of the back-reaction on the free energy of the reaction also is reproduced, including the special behavior in the "inverted region."},

The two?state models do not explicitly include the bath dynamics which lead to dephasing, and the models do not include tunneling. These are above barrier scattering exercises for which the dynamics is fully coherent. We apply our theory including an arbitrary dephasing time scale, and quantitatively reproduce the correct results for long dephasing times and qualitatively reproduce the results for short dephasing times. We conclude that our method is applicable to relaxation and activated processes in condensed matter where the dephasing time is unknown.

At low temperatures, the Kondo peak in the equilibrium density of states strongly enhances the linear-response conductance. Application of a finite voltage bias reduces the conductance and splits the peak in the density of states. The split peaks, one at each chemical potential, are suppressed in amplitude by a finite dissipative lifetime. We estimate this lifetime perturbatively as the time to transfer an electron from the higher chemical potential lead to the lower chemical potential one. At zero magnetic field, the clearest signatures of the Kondo effect in transport through a quantum dot are the broadening, shift, and enhancement of the linear-response conductance peaks at low temperatures, and a peak in the nonlinear differential conductance around zero bias.},

This fixed parameter corresponds, for example, to the characteristic thermal average decay time of nuclear overlaps of the bath. The MF/SH implementation includes decoherence only within the evolution of the primary subsystem that is responsible for transition probabilities but not within the auxiliary equations governing environmental molecular dynamics. Within this implementation, adiabatic MQC propagation is independent of decoherence rate, and only transition times are affected. Simulations with an average decoherence parameter of 6 fs extend the excited-state lifetime of the solvated electron by three and a half times compared to coherent evolution.

The characteristic decoherence time scale between a pair of states is evaluated from differences in the instantaneous Hellmann?Feynman forces on the two surfaces at each phase space point along the quantum?classical trajectory. Within this instantaneous decoherence mean field with surfacehopping (id-MF/SH) formalism, both the primary evolution that is responsible for transition probabilities and the auxiliary equations governing the nuclear dynamics are described by the same dissipative MQC Liouville?von Neumann equation. Decoherence, therefore, impacts both the transition probabilities and the realization of the quantum?classical trajectory. The method is implemented for the solvated electron in water and methanol and applied to trajectories describing photoexcitation of equilibrium ground-state species. Analysis reveals that, in general, both the decoherence time scale and the NA coupling increase with decreasing eigenstate energy gap. The cooperative combination of both strong coupling and large coherence as the energy levels approach each other gives rise to localized regions of comparatively higher transition probabilities. Excited-state survival probability analysis extracts a decay time of 1540 fs for the solvated electron in water and 2617 fs for the methanol case. The approximate agreement with the decay of time 2102 fs for the aqueous system, based on simulations employing a fixed 6 fs decoherence parameter, suggests that an average prescription of coherence loss may be adequate for the first-excited-state solvated electron system. The self-contained form of the id-MF/SH formalism, however, makes the new method a general approach to NA MQC-MD for condensed phase systems.},

	abstract = {Accurate characterization of correlated electronic states, as well as their evolution under external fields or in dissipative environment, is essentially important for understanding the properties of strongly correlated transition-metal materials involving spin-unpaired d or f electrons. This paper reviews the development and applications of a numerical simulation program, the Hierarchical Equations of Motion for QUantum Impurity with a Correlated Kernel (HEOM-QUICK), which allows for an accurate and universal characterization of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems. The HEOM-QUICK program implements the formally exact HEOM formalism for fermionic open systems. Its simulation results capture the combined effects of system-environment dissipation, many-body interactions, and non-Markovian memory in a nonperturbative manner. The HEOM-QUICK program has been employed to explore a wide range of static and dynamic properties of various types of quantum impurity systems, including charge or spin qubits, quantum dots, molecular junctions, and so on. It has also been utilized in conjunction with first-principles methods such as density-functional theory methods to study the correlated electronic structure of adsorbed magnetic molecules. The advantages in its accuracy, efficiency, and universality have made the HEOM-QUICK program a reliable and versatile tool for theoretical investigations on strong electron correlation effects in complex materials.

In this equation, the memory kernel accounts for the influence of the bath on the system's dynamics, and the inhomogeneous term accounts for initial system-bath correlations. In this paper, we propose a new approach for calculating the memory kernel and inhomogeneous term for arbitrary initial state and system-bath coupling. The memory kernel and inhomogeneous term are obtained by numerically solving a single inhomogeneous Volterra equation of the second kind for each. The new approach can accommodate a very wide range of projection operators, and requires projection-free two-time correlation functions as input. An application to the case of a two-state system with diagonal coupling to an arbitrary bath is described in detail. Finally, the utility and self-consistency of the formalism are demonstrated by an explicit calculation on a spin-boson model.},

The SCDM method is a modification of the semiclassical Ehrenfest (SE) method (also called the semiclassical time-dependent self-consistent-field method) that solves the problem of unphysical mixed final states by including decay-of-mixing terms in the equations for the evolution of the electronic state populations. These terms generate a force, called the decoherent force (or dephasing force), that drives the electronic component of each trajectory toward a pure state. Results for several mixed quantum-classical methods, in particular the SCDM, SE, and natural-decay-of-mixing methods and several trajectory surface hopping methods, are compared to the results of accurate quantum mechanical calculations for 12 cases involving five different fully dimensional triatomic model systems. The SCDM method is found to be the most accurate of the methods tested. The method should be useful for the simulation of photochemical reactions.},

	abstract = {The self-consistent decay-of-mixing (SCDM) semiclassical trajectory method for electronically nonadiabatic dynamics is improved by modifying the switching probability that determines the instantaneous electronic state toward which the system decoheres. This method is called coherent switching with decay of mixing (CSDM), and it differs from the previously presented SCDM method in that the electronic amplitudes controlling the switching of the decoherent state are treated fully coherently in the electronic equations of motion for each complete passage through a strong interaction region. It is tested against accurate quantum mechanical calculations for 12 atom-diatom scattering test cases. Also tested are the SCDM method and the trajectory surface hopping method of Parlant and Gislason that requires coherent passages through each strong interaction region, and which we call the "exact complete passage" trajectory surface hopping (ECP-TSH) method. The results are compared with previously presented results for the fewest switches with time uncertainty and Tully's fewest switches (TFS) surface hopping methods and the semiclassical Ehrenfest method. We find that the CSDM method is the most accurate of the semiclassical trajectory methods tested. Including coherent passages improves the accuracy of the SCDM method (i.e., the CSDM method is more accurate than the SCDM method) but not of the trajectory surface hopping method (i.e., the ECP-TSH method is not more accurate on average than the TFS method).},

In the present work we give an overview of theoretical methods used to analyze the transport properties of metal?molecular junctions as well as some relevant experiments and applications. After a brief general description of the electron transport through molecules we introduce a Hamiltonian which can be used to analyze electron?electron, electron?phonon and spin?orbit interactions. Then we turn to description of the commonly used transport theory formalisms including the nonequilibrium Green's functions based approach and the approach based on the ?master? equations. We discuss the most important effects which could be manifested through molecules in electron transport phenomena such as Coulomb, spin and Frank?Condon blockades, Kondo peak in the molecular conductance, negative differential resistance and some others. Bearing in mind that first principles electronic structure calculations are recognized as the indispensable basis of the theory of electron transport through molecules, we briefly discuss the main equations and some relevant applications of the density functional theory which presently is often used to analyze important characteristics of molecules and molecular clusters. Finally, we discuss some kinds of nanoelectronic devices built using molecules and similar systems such as carbon nanotubes, various nanowires and quantum dots.},

The main purpose is to allow for memory effects or causal time behavior, so that the response to a thermodynamic force comes later than the application of the force. This is accomplished by a statistical mechanical derivation of an exact non-Markoffian kinetic equation for the probability distribution in the space of macroscopic state variables. The memory effect in the resulting transport equations is represented by a time convolution of the thermodynamic forces with memory functions. The latter are time-correlation functions in the rates of change of the phase functions corresponding to macroscopic quantities. The resulting transport equations are not restricted to small deviations from thermal equilibrium. Onsager's theory is shown to be the low-frequency limit of our causal theory.},

	abstract = {The way in which the transition amplitude to an initially unoccupied state increases to its exponentially small final value is studied in detail in the adiabatic approximation, for a 2-state quantum system. By transforming to a series of superadiabatic bases, clinging ever closer to the exact evolving state, it is shown that transition histories renormalize onto a universal one, in which the amplitude grows to its final value as an error function (rather than via large oscillations as in the ordinary adiabatic basis). The time for the universal transition is of order \${\textbackslash}surd ({\textbackslash}hslash /{\textbackslash}delta)\$ where \${\textbackslash}delta \$ is the small adiabatic (slowness) parameter. In perturbation theory the pre-exponential factor of the final amplitude renormalizes superadiabatically from the incorrect value \$\{{\textbackslash}textstyle{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{3\}\}{\textbackslash}pi \$ (for the ordinary adiabatic basis) to the correct value unity. The various histories could be observed in spin experiments.},

Unusual changes in the surface electronic structure within 160 femtoseconds after excitation, observed by time-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy, are attributed to atomic motion in a copper–cesium bond-breaking process. Describing the change in energy of the cesium antibonding state with a simple classical model provides information on the mechanical forces acting on cesium atoms that are “turned on” by photoexcitation. Within 160 femtoseconds, the copper–cesium bond extends by 0.35 angstrom from its equilibrium value.},

Adsorbate motion both along and perpendicular to the rows of the Cu(110) surface occurs readily, in marked contrast to the behavior seen for equilibrium diffusion processes. The experimental findings for the probability and direction of the molecular motion can be understood as a manifestation of strong coupling between the adsorbates' lateral degrees of freedom and the substrate electronic excitation produced by the femtosecond laser radiation.
Fast laser pulses and scanning tunneling microscopy show that electronically excited CO molecules diffuse across rows of copper atoms, not along the rows as do those excited by thermal diffusion.

Because the CO molecules bound on different surface sites exhibit different C–O stretch vibrational frequencies, the site-to-site hopping, triggered by excitation with a laser pulse, can be determined from subpicosecond changes in the vibrational spectra. The unexpectedly fast motion—characterized by a 500-femtosecond time constant—reveals that a rotational motion of the CO molecules, rather than pure translation, is required for this diffusion process. This conclusion is corroborated by density functional theory calculations.
Diffusion of CO molecules on a stepped platinum surface is initiated by rotational motion, rather than the expected translational motion.

Electron transfer to a single molecule induced by green to near-infrared light in the junction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) exhibited spatially varying probability that is confined within the molecule. The mechanism involves photo-induced resonant tunneling in which a photoexcited electron in the STM tip is transferred to the molecule. The coupling of photons to the tunneling process provides a pathway to explore molecular dynamics with the combined capabilities of lasers and the STM.},

	abstract = {Separation of scales plays a fundamental role in the understanding of the dynamical behaviour of complex systems in physics and other natural sciences. A prominent example is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in molecular dynamics. This book focuses on a recent approach to adiabatic perturbation theory, which emphasizes the role of effective equations of motion and the separation of the adiabatic limit from the semiclassical limit.  A detailed introduction gives an overview of the subject and makes the later chapters accessible also to readers less familiar with the material. Although the general mathematical theory based on pseudodifferential calculus is presented in detail, there is an emphasis on concrete and relevant examples from physics. Applications range from molecular dynamics to the dynamics of electrons in a crystal and from the quantum mechanics of partially confined systems to Dirac particles and nonrelativistic QED.},

	abstract = {A chirp is a signal in which the frequency increases (up-chirp) or decreases (down-chirp) with time. In some sources, the term chirp is used interchangeably with sweep signal. It is commonly used in sonar and radar, but has other applications, such as in spread-spectrum communications. In spread-spectrum usage, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices such as reflective array compressors (RACs) are often used to generate and demodulate the chirped signals. In optics, ultrashort laser pulses also exhibit chirp, which, in optical transmission systems, interacts with the dispersion properties of the materials, increasing or decreasing total pulse dispersion as the signal propagates. The name is a reference to the chirping sound made by birds; see bird vocalization.},

	abstract = {We investigate theoretically photogeneration of excited carriers in plasmonic nanocrystals. The theory is based on the solution of the quantum equation of motion for the density matrix. Efficient photogeneration of plasmonic electrons and holes in small nanocrystals becomes possible due to the nonconservation of the electron momentum. The confinement and reflection of electrons in small nanocrystals allowed photon-assisted electron transitions with high excitation energies and therefore lead to a large number of energetic carriers. This process is a surface-scattering effect and efficient only for nanostructures with small sizes. Other important factors for the photogeneration effect are the field enhancement and the inhomogeneity of electromagnetic fields inside a plasmonic nanostructure. The plasmonic field effects strongly depend on the shape of the nanocrystal. For example, a plasmonic nanocube is more efficient for the electron photogeneration than a nanosphere and a nanosphere generates more energetic carriers compared to a plasmonic slab. The results obtained here can be used for designing plasmonic nanostructures for solar and photocatalytic applications.},

	abstract = {Plasmonic excitations in optically driven nanocrystals are composed of excited single-particle electron–hole pairs in the Fermi sea. In large nanostructures, most of the excited plasmonic electrons have relatively small excitation energies due to the conservation of linear momentum. However, small optically driven nanocrystals may have large numbers of hot electrons with large energies. In this study, we develop the concept of hot electron generation further by considering the effect of a plasmonic hot spot. Plasmonic hot spots are areas in a nanostructure with highly inhomogeneous and enhanced electric fields. In our model of a nanoparticle dimer, the hot spot region appears near the gap between the nanoparticles. We then apply the quantum formalism based on the density matrix to describe this system. We show that the electromagnetic enhancement and the nonconservation of linear momentum in the hot spot of the nanoparticle dimer lead to strongly increased rates of generation of energetic (hot) electrons. The rates of hot electron generation grow faster than the absorption cross section and the electromagnetic enhancement factor with the decrease of the gap between the nanoparticles. This happens due to the breaking of the linear momentum conservation of electrons in the hot spot regions. We also show that hot electron generation effect leads to the quantum mechanism of surface-induced absorption in nanocrystals that is an intrinsic property of any confined plasmonic system. The results obtained in this study can be useful for understanding and designing plasmonic photodetectors and hybrid materials for efficient photocatalysis.},

	abstract = {Plasmon-induced hot carrier formation is attracting an increasing research interest due to its potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection and solar energy harvesting. However, despite very significant experimental effort, a comprehensive theoretical description of the hot carrier generation process is still missing. In this work we develop a theoretical model for the plasmon-induced hot carrier process and apply it to spherical silver nanoparticles and nanoshells. In this model, the conduction electrons of the metal are described as free particles in a finite spherical potential well, and the plasmon-induced hot carrier production is calculated using Fermi’s golden rule. We show that the inclusion of many-body interactions has only a minor influence on the results. Using the model we calculate the rate of hot carrier generation, finding that it closely follows the spectral profile of the plasmon. Our analysis reveals that particle size and hot carrier lifetime play a central role in determining both the production rate and the energy distribution of the hot carriers. Specifically, larger nanoparticle sizes and shorter lifetimes result in higher carrier production rates but smaller energies, and vice versa. We characterize the efficiency of the hot carrier generation process by introducing a figure of merit that measures the number of high energy carriers generated per plasmon. Furthermore, we analyze the spatial distribution and directionality of these excitations. The results presented here contribute to the basic understanding of plasmon-induced hot carrier generation and provide insight for optimization of the process.},

	abstract = {The classification of electronic excitations in molecules and molecular nanostructures plays an important role when tailoring materials with desired properties. One example of such a class of excitations are plasmons. Plasmons appear in solid-state physics, where they are characterized as density oscillations in an electron gas that are driven by the restoring forces associated with the electromagnetic field induced by the density oscillations themselves. Here, we investigate how this concept can be transferred to molecular systems by performing a step-by-step analysis, starting from three-dimensional bulk systems and ending with molecules. On the basis of this analysis, we propose to scale the electron–electron interaction in quantum-chemical response calculations in order to identify plasmons in molecules. This approach is illustrated for molecular chains and clusters. Our results show that the concept of plasmons is still applicable for extended molecular systems and demonstrate that the proposed scaling approach provides an easy way of characterizing electronic excitations.},

	abstract = {The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of noble metal nanoparticles is reviewed in terms of both classical and quantum mechanical approaches. The collective oscillation of the free electrons responsible for the plasmon is well described using classical electromagnetic theory for large systems (from about 10 to 100 nm). In cases where quantum effects are important, this theory fails and first principle approaches like time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) must be used. In this paper, we give an account of the current understanding of the quantum mechanical origin of plasmon resonances. We provide some insight into how the discrete absorption spectrum of small noble metal clusters evolves into a strong plasmon peak with increasing particle size. The collective character of the plasmon is described in terms of the constructive addition of single-particle excitations. As the system size increases, the number of single-particle excitations increases as well. A configuration interaction (CI) approach can be applied to describe the optical properties of particles of all shapes and sizes, providing a consistent definition of plasmon resonances. Finally, we expand our analysis to thiolate-protected nanoparticles and analyze the effects of ligands on the plasmon.},

	abstract = {We determine the lifetime of the surface plasmon in metallic nanoparticles under various conditions, concentrating on the Landau damping, which is the dominant mechanism for intermediate-size particles. Besides the main contribution to the lifetime, which smoothly increases with the size of the particle, our semiclassical evaluation yields an additional oscillating component. For the case of noble metal particles embedded in a dielectric medium, it is crucial to consider the details of the electronic confinement; we show that in this case the lifetime is determined by the shape of the self-consistent potential near the surface. Strong enough perturbations may lead to the second collective excitation of the electronic system. We study its lifetime, which is limited by two decay channels: Landau damping and ionization. We determine the size dependence of both contributions and show that the second collective excitation remains as a well-defined resonance.},

Optical materials with abrupt changes of electromagnetic local densities of states enable steady-state population inversion of two-level atoms which is generally considered impossible. In previous studies, details of the population evolution of a single two-level atom were discussed. However, behaviors of the population evolution of collective two-level atoms are very different from those of a single two-level atom. In this paper, temporal behaviors of the collective population evolution for input electric fields with constant and time-dependent amplitudes are discussed in detail. Moreover, I develop the effective method to calculate the collective spontaneous emission for non-Markovian dynamics. Finally, I discuss the validity of the mean-field theory for a large number of two-level atoms in spontaneous emission using the Markovian approximation.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) 40 years ago, the origin of the “background” that is systematically observed in SERS spectra has remained questionable. To deeply analyze this phenomenon, plasmon-resonant Raman scattering was recorded under specific experimental conditions on a panel of composite multilayer samples containing noble metal (Ag and Au) nanoparticles. Stokes, anti-Stokes, and wide, including very low, frequency ranges have been explored. The effects of temperature, size (in the nm range), embedding medium (SiO2, Si3N4, or TiO2) or ligands have been successively analyzed. Both lattice (Lamb modes and bulk phonons) and electron (plasmon mode and electron-hole excitations) dynamics have been investigated. This work confirms that in Ag-based nanoplasmonics composite layers, only Raman scattering by single-particle electronic excitations accounts for the background. This latter appears as an intrinsic phenomenon independently of the presence of molecules on the metallic surface. Its spectral shape is well described by revisiting a model developed in the 1990s for analyzing electron scattering in dirty metals, and used later in superconductors. The gs factor, that determines the effective mean-free path of free carriers, is evaluated, gexpts=0.33±0.04, in good agreement with a recent evaluation based on time-dependent local density approximation gtheors=0.32. Confinement and interface roughness effects at the nanometer range thus appear crucial to understand and control SERS enhancement and more generally plasmon-enhanced processes on metallic surfaces.},

Moreover, resonance enhancement is of importance for the chemical contribution to surface-enhanced Raman scattering. In this work, we introduce a simplified sum-over-states scheme for computing Raman spectra and Raman excitation profiles. The proposed sum-over-states approach uses derivatives of electronic excitation energies and transition dipole moments, which can be efficiently computed from time-dependent density functional theory. We analyze and interpret the resonance Raman spectra and Raman excitation profiles of nucleic acid bases using the present approach. Contributions of individual excited states under strictly resonant and nonresonant conditions are investigated, and smooth interpolation between both limiting cases is obtained.},

In the RRS case, the polarizability derivatives are calculated from resonance polarizabilities by including a finite lifetime of the electronic excited states using time-dependent density-functional theory. The method is a short-time approximation to the Kramers, Heisenberg, and Dirac formalism. It is similar to the simple excited-state gradient approximation method if only one electronic excited state is important, however, it is not restricted to only one electronic excited state. Since the method can be applied to both NRS and RRS, it can be used to obtain complete Raman excitation profiles.

The new quantum mechanics could at first be used to answer questions concerning radiation only through analogies with the classical theory. In Heisenberg’s original matrix theory, for instance, it is assumed that the matrix elements of the polarisation of an atom determine the emission and absorption of radiation analogously to the Fourier components in the classical theory. In more recent theories a certain expression for the electric density obtained from the quantum mechanics is used to determine the emitted radiation by the same formulæ as in the classical theory. These methods give satisfactory results in many cases, but cannot even be applied to problems where the classical analogies are obscure or non-existent, such as resonance radiation and the breadths of spectral lines. A theory of radiation has been given by the author which rests on a more definite basis. It appears that one can treat a field of radiation as a dynamical system, whose interaction with an ordinary atomic system may be described by a Hamiltonian function. The dynamical variables specifying the field are the energies and phases of its various harmonic conrponents, each of which is effectively a simple harmonic oscillator. One must, of course, in the quantum theory take these variables to be q-numbers satisfying the proper quantum conditions. One finds then that the Hamiltonian for the interaction of the field with an atom is of the same form as that for the interaction of an assembly of light-quanta with the atom. There is thus a complete formal reconciliation between the wave and light-quantum points of view.},

The initial state is used as the local oscillator for heterodyne amplification of the excited charge distribution to retrieve real-space movies of atomic motion on ångstrom and femtosecond scales.

The symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) approach involves defining a classical action window function centered at integer quantum values of the action, choosing a width parameter that is less than unit quantum width, and applying the window function to both initial reactant and final product vibrational states. Calculations were performed using flat histogram windows and Gaussian windows over a range of width parameters. Use of the Wigner distribution function was also investigated as a possible choice. It was demonstrated for collinear H + H2 reactive scattering on the BKMP2 potential energy surface that reaction probabilities computed via the SQC methodology using a Gaussian window function of 1/2 unit width produces good agreement with quantum mechanical results over the 0.4–0.6 eV energy range relevant to the ground vibrational state to the ground vibrational state reactive transition.},

	abstract = {Extract
The new quantum theory, based on the assumption that the dynamical variables do not obey the commutative law of multiplication, has by now been developed sufficiently to form a fairly complete theory of dynamics. One can treat mathematically the problem of any dynamical system composed of a number of particles with instantaneous forces acting between them, provided it is describable by a Hamiltonian function, and one can interpret the mathematics physically by a quite definite general method. On the other hand, hardly anything has been done up to the present on quantum electrodynamics. The questions of the correct treatment of a system in which the forces are propagated with the velocity of light instead of instantaneously, of the production of an electromagnetic field by a moving electron, and of the reaction of this field on the electron have not yet been touched. In addition, there is a serious difficulty in making the theory satisfy all the requirements of the restricted principle of relativity, since a Hamiltonian function can no longer be used. This relativity question is, of course, connected with the previous ones, and it will be impossible to answer any one question completely without at the same time answering them all. However, it appears to be possible to build up a fairly satisfactory theory of the emission of radiation and of the reaction of the radiation field on the emitting system on the basis of a kinematics and dynamics which are not strictly relativistic. This is the main object of the present paper. The theory is noil-relativistic only on account of the time being counted throughout as a c-number, instead of being treated symmetrically with the space co-ordinates. The relativity variation of mass with velocity is taken into account without difficulty. The underlying ideas of the theory are very simple. Consider an atom interacting with a field of radiation, which we may suppose for definiteness to be confined in an enclosure so as to have only a discrete set of degrees of freedom. Resolving the radiation into its Fourier components, we can consider the energy and phase of each of the components to be dynamical variables describing the radiation field. Thus if Er is the energy of a component labelled r and θr is the corresponding phase (defined as the time since the wave was in a standard phase), we can suppose each Er and θr to form a pair of canonically conjugate variables. In the absence of any interaction between the field and the atom, the whole system of field plus atom will be describable by the Hamiltonian H ═ ΣrEr + Ho equal to the total energy, Ho being the Hamiltonian for the atom alone, since the variables Er, θr obviously satisfy their canonical equations of motion Er ═ — ∂H/∂θr ═ 0, θr ═ ∂H/∂Er ═ 1.},

We then provide a concise description of the relevant background physics of surface plasmon polaritons. An extensive overview of the historical background and a detailed discussion of more recent relevant experimental advances concerning strong coupling between surface plasmon polaritons and quantum emitters is then presented. Three conceptual frameworks are then discussed and compared in depth: classical, semi-classical and fully quantum mechanical; these theoretical frameworks will have relevance to strong coupling beyond that involving surface plasmon polaritons. We conclude our review with a perspective on the future of this rapidly emerging field, one we are sure will grow to encompass more intriguing physics and will develop in scope to be of relevance to other areas of science.},

Applications to CW light scattering as well as transient response and relaxation are described. Particular attention is given to so-called strong coupling limit, where the hybrid exciton-plasmon nature of the system response is strongly expressed. While traditional descriptions of such phenomena usually rely on analysis of the electromagnetic response of inhomogeneous dielectric environments that individually support plasmon and exciton excitations, here we explore also the consequences of a more detailed description of the molecular environment in terms of its quantum density matrix (applied in a mean field approximation level). Such a description makes it possible to account for characteristics that cannot be described by the dielectric response model: the effects of dephasing on the molecular response on one hand, and nonlinear response on the other. It also highlights the still missing important ingredients in the numerical approach, in particular its limitation to a classical description of the radiation field and its reliance on a mean field description of the many-body molecular system. We end our review with an outlook to the near future, where these limitations will be addressed and new novel applications of the numerical approach will be pursued.},

The effect is based on the correlated collective Dicke states which turn out to be highly entangled. Here we show that enhanced directional emission of spontaneous radiation can be produced also with statistically independent incoherent sources, via the measurement of higher-order correlation functions of the emitted radiation. Our analysis is applicable to a wide variety of quantum emitters, like trapped atoms, ions, quantum dots, or nitrogen-vacancy centers, and is also valid for incoherent classical emitters. This is experimentally confirmed with up to eight statistically independent thermal light sources. The arrangement to measure the higher-order correlation functions corresponds to a generalized Hanbury Brown–Twiss setup, demonstrating that the two phenomena, superradiance and the Hanbury Brown–Twiss effect, stem from the same interference phenomenon.},

This is done by numerically solving the corresponding system of coupled Maxwell-Liouville equations for various geometries. In particular, we scrutinize linear optical properties of nanoscale atomic clusters, demonstrating the significant role played by collective effects and dephasing. It is shown that subwavelength atomic clusters exhibit two resonant modes, one of which is localized slightly below the atomic transition frequency of an individual atom, while the other is positioned considerably above it. As an initial exploration of future applications of this approach, the optical response of core-shell nanostructures, with a core consisting of silver and a shell composed of resonant atoms, is examined.},

Without the process of turning the slow light into the coherence between the lower levels, the generation of SLP is more efficient. The Maxwell-Liouville equations are employed to study the light pulse dynamics in the samples coherently driven by a bichromatic standing wave. The solution indicates that the forward and backward components of the SLP approach to each other exponentially. Such property is described by introducing a quantity called characteristic length, which appeared to be the ratio of the optical coherence decay rate and the coefficient of the driving term in Maxwell equation. The necessary length for completing the conversion can be estimated as five times the characteristic length. Several materials are analyzed here, including the 87Rb atoms with different densities, Pr3+-doped yttrium orthosilicate (Pr:YSO), and nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond (N-V centers). The values of the characteristic length for the corresponding materials are calculated, as well as the necessary length.},

In addition to recovering the standard results, for instance, for π, 2π, and 4π pulses, several features in the results appear at the zeros of the driving pulse, where its time derivatives are maximum. Several ultrafast-pulse examples demonstrate that time-derivative-driven nonlinearities have a significant impact on the time evolution of a two-level atom system. Moreover, typical small-signal gain results are also obtained with our Maxwell-Bloch simulator. We illustrate that these time-derivative effects can be used to design an ultrafast, single-cycle pump pulse that completely inverts the two-level atom population. A pump-probe signal set is then used to illustrate gain in the probe signal.},

	abstract = {We extend to more than one spatial dimension the semiclassical full-wave vector Maxwell-Bloch equations for the purpose of achieving an adequate and rigorous description of ultrashort pulse propagation in optical waveguides containing resonant nonlinearities. Our considerations are based on the generalized pseudospin formalism introduced by Hioe and Eberly [Phys. Rev. Lett. 47, 838 (1981)] for treatment of the resonant coherent interactions of ultrashort light pulses with discrete-multilevel systems. A self-consistent set of coupled curl Maxwell-pseudospin equations in two spatial dimensions and time for the special case of a degenerate three-level system of quantum absorbers is originally derived. Maxwell’s curl equations are considered to be coupled via macroscopic medium polarization to the three-level atom model for the resonant medium. Two distinct sets of pseudospin equations are obtained corresponding to the TE- and TM-polarized optical waves. For the case of TM polarization, the electromagnetic wave is polarized in a general direction in the plane of incidence inducing two dipole transitions in a degenerate three-level system by each E-field component along the propagation axis and in transverse direction. We introduce a dipole-coupling interaction Hamiltonian allowing Rabi flopping of the population difference along and perpendicular to the propagation axis with frequencies depending on the corresponding field components. The relationship between the induced polarization and the state vector components that describe the evolution of the discrete-level system is derived in order to couple the quantum system equations to the Maxwell’s curl equations. The pseudospin equations are phenomenologically extended to include relaxation effects by introducing nonuniform decay times corresponding to the various dipole transitions occurring in a three-level system. The system has been discretized using finite differences on a Yee grid and solved numerically by an iterative predictor-corrector finite-difference time-domain method. Self-induced transparency soliton propagation through a degenerate three-level quantum system of absorbers in two spatial dimensions and time is demonstrated in planar parallel-mirror waveguide geometries.},

The existence of false precursors is shown to be associated with singularities at the origin in certain momentum space representations of the propagators and this allows a prescription to be given to eliminate such precursors. This prescription is proved equivalent to an exact consideration of the near fields associated with quantum transitions. The analogous treatment for the state vectors in decaying systems is carried through and is applied in detail to the problems of the shape of natural spectral lines and the transition rate for stimulated emission. It is shown that the expected line shape for the Lamb 1057 Mc/s line in hydrogen is Lorentzian within the context of Lamb’s experiments—intensity against Zeeman splitting energy. This is in contradiction to the predictions of Arnous and Heitler. The distribution in k (circular frequency) for a natural line, on the other hand, has a factor k{\textless}super{\textgreater}a{\textless}/super{\textgreater} times the resonant denominator. The definitive position between the conflicting transition rates in the literature is given. The relationship of the calculations to a gauge-independent Hamiltonian, considered in the paper, is investigated in detail. This Hamiltonian, transformed canonically from the conventional one, is shown to be valid for internal, dynamical, quantized electromagnetic fields; its analogue in the case of external applied fields being well known. It is demonstrated that the transformation eliminates many of the difficulties associated with the false near fields and that it also allows certain radiative effects, where the atom acts as a whole, to be computed in a straightforward manner.},

We consider three flavors of mixed quantum-classical dynamics: the classical path approximation (CPA), Ehrenfest dynamics, and symmetrical quantum-classical (SQC) dynamics. The CPA fails to recover a consistent description of spontaneous emission. A consistent "spontaneous" emission can be obtained from Ehrenfest dynamics--provided that one starts in an electronic superposition state. Spontaneous emission is always obtained using SQC dynamics. Using the SQC and Ehrenfest frameworks, we further calculate the dynamics following an incoming pulse, but here we find very different responses: SQC and Ehrenfest dynamics deviate sometimes strongly in the calculated rate of decay of the transient excited state. Nevertheless, our work confirms the earlier observations by W. Miller [J. Chem. Phys. 69, 2188-2195, 1978] that Ehrenfest dynamics can effectively describe some aspects of spontaneous emission and highlights new possibilities for studying light-matter interactions with semiclassical mechanics.},

The conventional Lagrangian of the system in an arbitrary gauge is converted to a new form by transformation to another arbitrary gauge, and a new formulation of the theory is obtained by expressing the new Lagrangian in terms of the initial potentials. Thus different gauge transformations produce different momenta π conjugate to the initial vector potential A, and hence different forms of Hamiltonian. The transformations that produce the Coulomb-gauge and Power-Zienau-Woolley (P.Z.W.) Hamiltonians are considered in detail. It is shown that Π is transverse in both cases and only the transverse part of A is accordingly involved in the field quantization; neither the longitudinal part of A nor the scalar potential appears explicitly, the instantaneous Coulomb energies being included via an electronic polarization determined by the gauge generator. The transformations between gauges are illustrated by simple diagrammatic representations of A and Π. Compararison with the commonly used unitary transformation derivation of the P.Z.W. Hamiltonian emphasizes the need for a careful reinterpretation of the physical significance of Π after the unitary transformation has been made.},

The classical changes in relative energy and angular momentum associated with this description just balance the corresponding quantum changes in internal energy and angular momentum for the transition involved. The work is based on a generalization of Hamilton's principle, suggested in a natural way by Feynman's formulation of quantum mechanics; the semiclassical scattering theory which emerges is, in essence, a justification and extension of the impact-parameter method. Applications to low-energy atomic collisions are discussed briefly.},

	abstract = {A justification is given for the use of non-spreading or frozen gaussian packets in dynamics calculations. In this work an initial wavefunction or quantum density operator is expanded in a complete set of grussian wavepackets. It is demonstrated that the time evolution of this wavepacket expansion for the quantum wavefunction or density is correctly given within the approximations employed by the classical propagation of the avarage position and momentum of each gaussian packet, holding the shape of these individual gaussians fixed. The semiclassical approximation is employed for the quantum propagator and the stationary phase approximation for certain integrals is utilized in this derivation. This analysis demonstrates that the divergence of the classical trajectories associated with the individual gaussian packets accounts for the changes in shape of the quantum wavefunction or density, as has been suggested on intuitive grounds by Heller. The method should be exact for quadratic potentials and this is verified by explicitly applying it for the harmonic oscillator example.},

	abstract = {Raman Spectroscopy, Volume 1, was conceived to provide integrated and comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the field by a group of specialists. However, in the three years since the first volume was published much important work has been done. Since Volume 1 was very well received, this second volume has been prepared in the belief that an extension of the coverage it offers will satisfy a real need in this rapidly changing and extremely interesting field. Any pretension to comprehensive coverage, however, had to be abandoned. In order to keep the material in a work of this nature up to date, a cutoff date has to be set. Inevitably one or two of the planned articles fail to materialize by this deadline, and other interesting topics may come into focus too late to permit the preparation of a worthwhile discussion by the target date. Still, in fairness to those authors who kept to the schedule, the cutoff date has to be enforced, even though this means sacrificing breadth of coverage to timeliness. I wish to thank all the contributors to this volume for their effort, their cooperation, and their punctuality, and it is my hope that the policy I have followed will result in the presentation of current thought on a series of interesting aspects of the subject of Raman spectroscopy.
